35193118	 MESHD018487  Procedure in a Patient with  MESHD002312 : A Case Report Surgical septal myectomy is the preferred treatment option for patients with medically intractable  MESHD002312 . Extended transaortic septal myectomy is a widely performed surgical procedure for patients with subaortic  MESHD000402 . The transapical approach may provide an alternative surgical option in less common phenotypes, such as  MESHD006984  or long-segmental septal  MESHD006984 . In this report, we describe a case of a procedure performed to achieve left  MESHD006529  procedure using a combined transaortic and transapical dual approach in a patient with diffuse-type  MESHD002312  with  MESHD000783  and mid-cavity  MESHD000402 . 
35248534	An antibody Fc engineered for conditional antibody-dependent cellular  MESHD064420  at the  MESHD009800  microenvironment pH Despite the exquisite specificity and high affinity of antibody-based  MESHD009369  therapies, treatment side effects can occur since the  MESHD009369 -associated antigens targeted are also present on healthy cells. However, the low  NCBIGene5053  NCBIGene5053  of the  MESHD009369  microenvironment provides an opportunity to develop conditionally active antibodies with enhanced  MESHD009369  specificity. Here, we engineered the human IgG1 Fc domain to enhance  NCBIGene5053  NCBIGene5053 -selective binding to the receptor  NCBIGene2214  NCBIGene2214  and subsequent antibody-dependent cellular  MESHD064420  (ADCC). We displayed the Fc domain on the surface of mammalian cells and generated a site-directed library by altering Fc residues at the Fc- NCBIGene2214  NCBIGene2214  interface to support interactions with positively charged  MESHD006639  residues. We then used a competitive staining and flow cytometric selection strategy to isolate Fc variants exhibiting reduced  NCBIGene2214  NCBIGene2214  affinities at neutral pH, but physiological affinities at the  MESHD009369 -typical pH 6.5. We demonstrate that antibodies composed of  NCBIGene2187  NCBIGene2187  arms binding the breast cell epithelial marker  NCBIGene2064  NCBIGene2064  and the lead Fc variant, termed acid-Fc, exhibited an ~2-fold pH-selectivity for  NCBIGene2214  NCBIGene2214  binding based on the ratio of equilibrium dissociation constants Kd,7.4/Kd,6.5, due to a faster dissociation rate at pH 7.4. Finally, in vitro ADCC assays with human  NCBIGene2214  NCBIGene2214 -positive natural killer and  NCBIGene2064  NCBIGene2064 -positive target cells demonstrated similar activities for anti- NCBIGene2064  NCBIGene2064  antibodies bearing the wild-type or acid-Fc at pH 6.5, but nearly 20-fold reduced ADCC for acid-Fc at pH 7.4, based on EC50 ratios. This work shows the promise of mammalian cell display for Fc engineering and the feasibility of pH-selective Fc activation to provide a second dimension of selective  MESHD009369  cell targeting. 
35509460	Recognition competes with hydration in anion-triggered monolayer formation of cyanostar supra-amphiphiles at aqueous interfaces  The triggered self-assembly of surfactants into organized layers at aqueous interfaces is important for creating adaptive nanosystems and understanding selective ion extraction. While these transformations require molecular recognition, the underlying driving forces are modified by the local environment in ways that are not well understood. Herein, we investigate the role of ion binding and ion hydration using cyanosurf, which is composed of the cyanostar macrocycle, and its binding to anions that are either size-matched or mis-matched and either weakly or highly hydrated. We utilize the supra-amphiphile concept where an MESHD000838 inding converts cyanosurf into a charged and amphiphilic complex triggering its self-organization into monolayers at the air-wa MESHD014867 nterface. Initially, cyanosurf forms aggregates at the surface of a pure wa MESHD014867 olution. When the weakly hydrated and size-matched hexafluorophosphate (PF NCBIGene200162  NCBIGene200162  and pe MESHC494474 Cl MESHC494474 anions are added, the macrocycles form distinct monolayer architectures. Surface-pressure isotherms reveal significant reorganization of the surface-active molecules upon anion binding while infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy show the ion-bound complexes are well ordered at the interface. Vibrational sum frequency generation spectroscopy shows the wa MESHD014867 olecules in the interfacial region are highly ordered in response to the charged monolayer of cyanosurf complexes. Consistent with the importance of recognition, we find the smaller mis-matched ch MESHD002712 oes not trigger the transformation. However, the size-matched ph MESHD010710 H2PO4-) also does not trigger monolayer formation indicating hydration inhibits its interfacial binding. These studies reveal how anion-selective recognition and hydration both control the binding and thus the switching of a responsive molecular interface. The selective binding of anions transform macrocycles into amphiphiles that form monolayers on the surface of water depe MESHD014867  upon the relative roles of anion hydration and anion recognition. 
35085439	 MESHD013455  and Phosphorus Oxyacid Radicals We report a computational study of the little-studied neutral  MESHC042345 , bisulfate, dihydro-phosphite, and dihydro-phosphate radicals (HSOx , H2POx , x = 3,4), calling special attention to their various tautomeric structures together with pKa values estimated from the Gibbs free energies of their dissociations (at the G4 and CAM-B3LYP levels of density functional theory). The energetics of microhydration clusters with up to four  MESHD014867  molecules for the S-based species and up to eight  MESHD014867  molecules for the P-based species were investigated. The number of microhydrating  MESHD014867  molecules needed to induce spontaneous de-protonation is found to correlate the acid strength of each radical. According to the computed Gibbs free reaction and activation energies, S- and P-centered radicals preferentially add to the double bond of  MESHC013658  (a  MESHD008055  model), whereas the O-centered radical tautomers prefer H-abstraction. The likely downstream reactions of these radicals in biological media are discussed. 
35497620	Enhancing the antivirus activity of chimeric  NCBITaxon9615  NCBITaxon9615  interferon with ricin subunit B by using nanoparticle formulations Despite interferon alpha having a broad spectrum of antiviral activity and strong antiproliferative activity, its applications are severely limited due to the intrinsic properties of proteins, such as poor stability and short serum half-life. In our study, canine interferon alpha (CaIFNalpha) gene was fused with the ricin toxin B chain (RTB) to form rCaIFNalpha/RTB, which encodes a 463-amino acid protein containing a 15-amino acid encoded (G4S)3 flexible linker. After expression in prokaryote, purification and renaturation, the  MESHD064420  and antiviral activity of rCaIFNalpha/RTB were investigated in  9615  ( 9615 ) cells. rCaIFNalpha/RTB exerted a superior anti- MESHD054243  ( NCBITaxon11276  NCBITaxon11276 ) activity on  9615  cells. Furthermore, we have developed a nanoparticle formulation of rCaIFNalpha/RTB by using  MESHD011094  ( MESHD011094 ) through electrostatic interaction. rCaIFNalpha/RTB@PEI10000 is more stable than rCaIFNalpha/RTB at various pH and temperature levels, and it possesses enhanced antiviral activity. Our findings facilitate further research on the role of type I IFN in antiviral defense responses in  NCBITaxon9615  NCBITaxon9615 . Despite interferon alpha having a broad spectrum of antiviral activity and strong antiproliferative activity, its applications are severely limited due to the intrinsic properties of proteins, such as poor stability and short serum half-life. 
35519722	Coordinating capillary infiltration with anodic oxidation: a multi-functional strategy for electrochemical fabrication of  MESHD006108   Electrochemical exfoliation of gr MESHD006108 tands out as a promising alternative to the existing methods for scalable gr MESHD006108 abrication. However, factors governing the electrochemical process and the underlying mechanism are complex and how to effectively control the exfoliation process is far from completely clear despite many attempts in previous works. Herein, for the first time, capillary infiltration, anodic oxidation and their dependence on temperature were found to be critical in determining the electrolyte infiltration and the anodic oxidation process. On this basis, we achieved tuning of sheet dimensions (both thickness and lateral size) and surface chemistry of gr MESHD006108 y facilely controlling the temperature (5-95  C). Four kinds of gr MESHD006108 aterials featuring small size, porosity, wa MESHD014867 ispersibility and large size can be selectively fabricated in the same electrolyte system at different temperatures. Especially, low-temperature exfoliation results in high yields (99.5%) of small-sized gr MESHD006108 which is a new breakthrough for electrochemical methods. The finding and associated mechanism of temperature's influence on both capillary infiltration and anodic oxidation not only deepen our understanding of the electrochemical exfoliation, but also make electrochemistry a versatile technique for gr MESHD006108 abrication. Coordinating the capillarity infiltration with anodic oxidation enables electrochemical fabrication of various graph MESHD006108 rials at different temperatures. 
34314500	Outcomes linked to eligibility for stem cell transplantation trials in diffuse  MESHD045743  Abstract Objectives The aim of this study was to explore outcomes in a cohort of dcSSc patients fulfilling eligibility criteria for stem cell transplantation (SCT) studies but receiving standard immunosuppression. Methods From a large single-centre dcSSc cohort (n = 636), patients were identified using the published SCT trials' inclusion criteria. Patients meeting the trials' exclusion criteria were excluded. Results Of the 227 eligible patients, 214 met the inclusion criteria for ASTIS (Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation International Scleroderma), 82 for SCOT (Scleroderma: Cyclophosphamide Or Transplantation) and 185 for the UPSIDE (UPfront autologous haematopoietic Stem cell transplantation vs Immunosuppressive medication in early DiffusE cutaneou MESHD045743  and 66 were excluded based on age >65 years, low diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLco), pulmonar MESHD006976 tini MESHD003404 ce <40 ml/min. The mean follow-up time was 12 years (s.d. 7). Among the eligible patients, 103 (45.4%) died. Su MESHD003643 al was 96% at 2 years, 88% at 5 years, 73% at 10 years and 43% at 20 years. Compared with this 'SCT-eligible' cohort, those patients who would have been excluded from SCT trials had a worse long-term survival (97% at 2 years, 77% at 5 years, 52% at 10 years and 15% at 20 years, log rank P < 0.001). Excluded patients also had a significantly worse long-term event-free survival. Hazard of death wa MESHD003643 her in patients with higher age at onset [hazard ratio (HR) 1.05, P < 0.001], higher ESR at baseline (HR 1.01, P = 0.025) and males (HR 2.12, P = 0.008). Conclusion SCT inclusion criteria identify patients with poor outcome despite current best practice treatment. Patients meeting the inclusion criteria for SCT but who would have been excluded from the trials because of age, pulmonary hypertension, poor kidney function or DL MESHD006976 omes. 
35199148	 localpdb:a Python package to manage protein structures and their annotations Abstract Motivation The wealth of protein structures collected in the Protein Data Ba NCBIGene55024  NCBIGene55024 nabled large-scale studies of their function and evolution. Such studies, however, require the generation of customized datasets combining the structural data with miscellaneous accessory resources providing functional, taxonomic and other annotations. Unfortunately, the functionality of currently available tools for the creation of such datasets is limited and their usage frequently requires laborious surveying of various data sources and resolving inconsistencies between their versions. Results To address this problem, we developed localpdb, a versatile Python library for the management of protein structures and their annotations. The library features a flexible plugin system enabling seamless unification of the structural data with diverse auxiliary resources, full version control and powerful functionality of creating highly customized datasets. The localpdb can be used in a wide range of bioinformatic tasks, in particular those involving large-scale protein structural analyses and machine learning. Availability and implementation  localpdb is freely available at https://github.com/labstructbioinf/localpdb.

35497384	 MESHD008476 : the emerging role for cardiac magnetic resonance imaging in the diagnosis of  MESHD008476  
35495276	Direct observation of  MESHC004784  trapped by MOF proving efficient removal of  MESHD013455  impurities  Here, we report the adsorptive removal of trace amounts of di MESHC004784 DM MESHC004784 using me MESHD008670 rganic frameworks (MOFs). Cu2+-based MOFs with open metal sites (OMSs), [Cu3(btc)2] (HKUST-1), where btc = 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylate, and without OMSs, [Cu2(bdc)2(dabco)] (Cu-JAST-1), where bdc = 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate and dabco = 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, were investigated for the removal of DMS to compare their performance with that of Ag-Y zeolite, which is currently widely used in industry. HKUST-1 exhibited a considerably higher adsorption capacity for DMS than the other adsorbents, which was confirmed by breakthrough measurements. The adsorption state of DMS with HKUST-1 was directly revealed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SXRD) analysis and in situ Raman spectroscopy. In addition, it was shown that DMS can be removed by HKUST-1 even under humid conditions. OMSs in HKUST-1 can strongly trap DMS ev MESHC004784 under humid conditions, which was directly proved by in situ single-crystal X-ray diffraction and Raman measurements. 
35496176	Prediction of Human-Computer Interaction Intention Based on Eye Movement and Electroencephalograph Characteristics In order to solve the problem of unsmooth and inefficient human-computer interaction process in the information age, a method for human-computer interaction intention prediction based on electroencephalograph (EEG) signals and eye movement signals is proposed. This approach is different from previous methods where researchers predict using data from human-computer interaction and a single physiological signal. This method uses the eye movements and EEG signals that clearly characterized the interaction intention as the prediction basis. In addition, this approach is not only tested with multiple human-computer interaction intentions, but also takes into account the operator in different cognitive states. The experimental results show that this method has some advantages over the methods proposed by other researchers. In Experiment 1, using the eye movement signal fixation point abscissa Position X (PX), fixation point ordinate Position Y (PY), and saccade amplitude ( NCBIGene6296  NCBIGene6296 ) to judge the interaction intention, the accuracy reached 92%, In experiment 2, only relying on the pupil diameter, pupil size (PS) and fixed time, fixed time ( MESHD004402 ) of eye movement signals can not achieve higher accuracy of the operator's cognitive state, so EEG signals are added. The cognitive state was identified separately by combining the screened EEG parameters Ralpha/beta with the eye movement signal pupil diameter and fixation time, with an accuracy of 91.67%. The experimental combination of eye movement and EEG signal features can be used to predict the operator's interaction intention and cognitive state. 
35516677	Mucormycosis following  MESHC000657245   MESHD007239 -An epidemic developing in a pandemic, a case series from a tertiary care hospital of India When the world is still struggling to fight the  MESHC000657245  pandemic, an epidemic of mucormycosis following the  MESHC000657245   MESHD007239  is increasing in India. Mucormycosis is a rare life-threatening fungal  MESHD007239  with a high  MESHD003643  rate. Is this increase due to the rampant usage of corticosteroids, some  MESHD007154  in  MESHC000657245 , uncontrolled blood sugar, increased ferritin, use of industrial  MESHD010100 , use of unsterile mask, or use of unsterile  MESHD014867  as a humidifier in  MESHD010100  delivery systems? This remains a question. In this case series, we present five cases of  MESHD009091  which followed after the  MESHC000657245   MESHD007239  in these patients. We have included patients' clinical, laboratory, and radiological data in this case series and reviewed the literature. 
35480622	Evaluation of Urgent Retinal Practice and Safety Measures for Physicians and Patients During  MESHC000657245  Pandemic Purpose To assess the impact of the  MESHC000657245  pandemic on urgent retina practice and factors influencing adherence of physicians and patients to safety measures. Methods In this clinical audit, urgent or  MESHD007431  that presented to our hospital during the period of 15th March-15th May 2020 were compared with the period just before the pandemic declaration (15th December 2019-15th February 2020). Additionally, two questionnaires assessing the adherence to safety measures were circulated to the medical personnel and a sample of patients. The collected data were analyzed, and accordingly, recommendations were proposed to the hospital administration and specific corrective measures were applied. The outcome of applying these corrective measures was assessed in the re-audit cycle during the period of 15th June-15th August 2020. Results There was a significant decrease in the number of urgent or emerge MESHD007431 presented to our hospital during the pandemic (161 versus 302 cases in a similar period before the pandemic; p = 0.022). Just with the pandemic recession, there was a significant increase in the number of urgent cases (391 versus 161 cases during the pandemic; p = 0.006), also there was an increased number of complex cases. Residents and fellows were less compliant than attending physicians in adherence to safety measures. Conclusion Delayed presentation of urgent retinal cases during the pandemic highlights the importance of public awareness of urgent conditions that need immediate medical or surgical care. Attention to young physicians during the pandemic is crucial as they are less adherent to safety measures due to work overload. 
35479643	In vitro Sequestration of Molecular and Mass Spectra Characterized Metallophilic  MESHD002104  Tolerant Bacteria for Sustainable Agriculture Due to industrialization, the contamination of toxic metals in soils is currently one of the major concerns to scientists worldwide. The presence of high concentrations of heavy metals including  MESHD002104  in the environment is mainly attributed to human activities. Being a highly toxic  MESHD008670 ,  MESHD002104  can enter plant cell transporters usually used for the uptake of essential cations, such as  MESHD007501 ,  MESHD002118 , and zinc. This study deals with the appraisement of response and tolerance shown by various bacteria in varied  MESHD002104  concentrations (100-1,000 ppm). The optical density (OD) of the isolates was measured to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of  MESHD002104 . Isolated bacteria have been identified using 16S rRNA gene sequence and Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). Among the 72 isolates, 07 ( NCBITaxon1408  NCBITaxon1408 ,  NCBITaxon208224  NCBITaxon208224 , Klebsiella pneumonia,  NCBITaxon75612  NCBITaxon75612 ,  NCBITaxon303  NCBITaxon303 ,  NCBITaxon46257  NCBITaxon46257 , and  NCBITaxon246432  NCBITaxon246432 ), isolates had efficacy for  MESHD002104  tolerance and showed sequestration potential at varying MIC. Furthermore, K.  MESHD011014  was observed to have the highest (900 ppm) tolerance for  MESHD002104  and the lowest (600 ppm) was shown by  NCBITaxon208224  NCBITaxon208224 . Besides, K.  MESHD011014  showed the highest (75.2%) sequestration potential while the least (52.4%) potential was observed for  NCBITaxon303  NCBITaxon303 . These  MESHD002104  tolerant species can be implemented in contaminated environments for detoxification and elimination of  MESHD002104  from these agricultural fields. 
35477744	Reliability and concurrent validity of the Spinal Cord Independence Measure III among rehabilitation professionals Study design A cross-sectional design. Objectives To investigate rater reliability of the Spinal Cord Independence Measure or SCIM III among rehabilitation professionals, along with the concurrent validity of the tool as compared to standard measures covering wheelchair users (WU) and ambulatory (AM) individuals with  MESHD013119  (SCI). Setting A tertiary rehabilitation center and communities. Methods Eighty-two participants with SCI (39 WU and 43 AM individuals) were assessed using SCIM III items. The data of first 30 participants were video recorded for rater reliability assessments by seven rehabilitation professionals, including nurses, occupational therapists, and physical therapists (one novice and one experienced rater for each professional). All participants were also assessed using standard measures to verify concurrent validity of SCIM III by an experienced rater. Results The SCIM III showed excellent intra-rater and inter-rater reliability among rehabilitation professionals when analyzed for overall items (intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) >0.90) and separately for each subscale (kappa values >0.80). The total SCIM III of WU and the mobility scores of AM participants showed significant correlation with standard measures for muscle strength, limit of stability, balance control, functional endurance, and walking ability (rs = 0.343-0.779; p < 0.05). Conclusions The present findings extend clinical benefit and confirm the use of SCIM III interchangeably among rehabilitation professionals after they have been adequately trained. The findings are important for community-based rehabilitation and home healthcare services, especially during the coronaviru NCBITaxon11118  NCBITaxon11118 )  MESHC000657245 , when hospital beds and in-patient services are limited for individuals with SCI.

The 5'-phosphite monomers are synthesized in a single step from unprotected 2'-deoxyribonucleosides using 5'-O-selective phosphitylation and can be applied to the synthetic cycle of the H-phosphonate method. We synthesized four kinds of 5'-phosphite monomers and then optimized the conditions for the condensation between the 3'-hydroxy groups of the 5'-phosphite monomers and the H-phosphonate monoesters. As a result of various investigations, solution-phase synthesis of trithymidine diphosphate (TTT) and tetramers containing four kinds of nucleobases was achieved according to the procedure consisting of repeated condensation, deprotection, and purification using simple extraction or precipitation. A new strategy for a solution-phase synthesis of oligodeoxyribonucl MESHD009838  monomers synthesized in a single step from unprotected 2'-deoxyribonucleosides. 
35476450	The immune checkpoint  NCBIGene102657  NCBIGene102657  ( NCBIGene102657  NCBIGene102657 ) regulates adipocyte progenitor metabolism and  MESHD009765  development The immune checkpoint  NCBIGene102657  NCBIGene102657  ( NCBIGene102657  NCBIGene102657 ) is a member of the B7 family that has been studied in the  MESHD009369  microenvironment and immunotherapy, but its potential role in metabolism remains largely unknown. Here, we show that  NCBIGene102657  NCBIGene102657  is highly expressed in  NCBITaxon10090  NCBITaxon10090  and human  NCBIGene230796  NCBIGene230796  tissue at steady state, with the highest levels in adipocyte progenitor cells.  NCBIGene80381  NCBIGene80381  is rapidly down-regulated upon the initiation of adipocyte differentiation. Combined RNA sequencing and metabolic studies reveal that  NCBIGene80381  NCBIGene80381  stimulates glycolytic and mitochondrial activity of adipocyte progenitors. Loss of  NCBIGene80381  NCBIGene80381  in progenitors results in impaired oxidative metabolism program and increased  MESHD008055  accumulation in derived adipocytes. Consistent with these observations,  NCBITaxon10090  NCBITaxon10090  knocked out for  NCBIGene102657  NCBIGene102657  develop spontaneous  MESHD009765 ,  MESHD008659 , and  NCBIGene230796  NCBIGene230796  tissue  MESHD007249 . Our results reveal an unexpected metabolic role for  NCBIGene102657  NCBIGene102657  in  NCBIGene230796  NCBIGene230796  tissue and open potential new avenues for the treatment of  MESHD008659  by targeting the  NCBIGene102657  NCBIGene102657  pathway. The immune checkpoint  NCBIGene102657  NCBIGene102657  modulates adipocyte progenitor metabolism and protects against  MESHD009765 . 
35508609	Dynamic magnetic resonance imaging of muscle contraction in facioscapulohumeral  MESHD009136  Quantitative muscle MRI ( MESHD014867 -T2 and fat mapping) is being increasingly used to assess disease involvement in  MESHD009135 , while imaging techniques for assessment of the dynamic and elastic muscle properties have not yet been translated into clinics. In this exploratory study, we quantitatively characterized  MESHD063806  (strain) in patients affected by facioscapulohumeral  MESHD009136  ( NCBIGene2489  NCBIGene2489 ), a prevalent  MESHD009136 , by applying dynamic MRI synchronized with neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES). We evaluated the quadriceps muscles in 34 ambulatory patients and 13 healthy controls, at 6-to 12-month time intervals. While a subgroup of patients behaved similarly to controls, for another subgroup the median strain decreased over time (approximately 57% over 1.5 years). Dynamic MRI parameters did not correlate with quantitative MRI. Our results suggest that the evaluation of muscle contraction by NMES-MRI is feasible and could potentially be used to explore the elastic properties and monitor muscle involvement in  NCBIGene2489  NCBIGene2489  and other  MESHD009468 .

35477938	Peptidoglycan biosynthesis is driven by  MESHD008055  transfer along enzyme-substrate affinity gradients Maintenance of bacterial cell shape and resistance to osmotic  MESHD000079225  by the peptidoglycan (PG) renders PG biosynthetic enzymes and precursors attractive targets for combating  MESHD001424 . Here, by applying native mass spectrometry, we elucidate the effects of  MESHD008055  substrates on the PG membrane enzymes MraY, MurG, and MurJ. We show that dimerization of MraY is coupled with binding of the carrier  MESHD008055  substrate  MESHC009621  (C55-P). Further, we demonstrate the use of native  NCBITaxon2710868  NCBITaxon2710868  for biosynthetic reaction monitoring and find that the passage of substrates and products is controlled by the relative binding affinities of the different membrane enzymes. Overall, we provide a molecular view of how PG membrane enzymes convey  MESHD008055  precursors through favourable binding events and highlight possible opportunities for intervention. Bacterial cell wall enzymes and their precursors are critical targets for antibiotic development. Here, the authors investigate several biosynthetic enzymes with their substrates and show that the passage of substrates and products in the pathway is controlled by their relative binding affinities. 
35494470	Calculating the absolute binding free energy of the  NCBIGene397415  NCBIGene397415  dimer in an explicit solvent  NCBIGene397415  NCBIGene397415  is a significant hormone in the regulation of  MESHD005947  level in the blood. Its monomers bind to each other to form dimers or hexamers through a complex process. To study the binding of the  NCBIGene397415  NCBIGene397415  dimer, we first calculate its absolute binding free energy by the steered molecular dynamics method and the confinement method based on a fictitious thermodynamic cycle. After considering some special correction terms, the final calculated binding free energy at 298 K is -8.97 +- 1.41 kcal mol-1, which is close to the experimental value of -7.2 +- 0.8 kcal mol-1. Furthermore, we discuss the important residue-residue interactions between the  NCBIGene397415  NCBIGene397415  monomers, including hydrophobic interactions, pi-pi interactions and  MESHD006859  bond interactions. The analysis reveals five key residues, VlaB12, TyrB16, PheB24, PheB25, and TyrB26, for the dimerization of the  NCBIGene397415  NCBIGene397415 . We also perform MM- MESHC437084  calculations for the wild-type dimer and some mutants and study the roles of the key residues by the change of the binding energy of the  NCBIGene397415  NCBIGene397415  dimer. In this paper, we calculate the absolute binding free energy of an insulin dime NCBIGene397415  NCBIGene397415 eered MD method. The result of -8.97 kcal mol-1 is close to the experimental value -7.2 kcal mol-1. We also analyze the residue-residue interactions.

Thirteen elite, junior, male basketball players were monitored using electronic performance tracking systems. There were studied intervals for different time windows to determine the external PD for distance (m); player load; distance covered in four different zones; accelerations; and decelerations. A mixed linear model was run to identify differences among quarters, and the auto-correlation function was carried out to determine fluctuations across the whole game. The results showed significant differences between Q1 vs. Q2 for distance, player load, and standing-walking distance; between Q1 vs. Q3 for distance, player load, and HSR; between Q1 vs. Q4 for distance, player load, standing-walking, and HSR; and between Q3 vs. Q4 for distance and player load. These findings suggest that external PD for running-based demands (distance, player load, and high-speed running) decrease across basketball games with the most notable declines occurring between the first and fourth quarters. Nevertheless, it is important to note that non-significant differences were found between quarters for several external PD variables (jogging, running, acceleration, and deceleration) across different time windows. Findings from the present study reinforce the importance of considering specific PD variables for different functions due to the specific insight each provides. 
35495729	Alterations and Correlations of  NCBIGene110006  NCBIGene110006  Microbiota and Fecal Metabolome Characteristics in Experimental  MESHD010518  Rats Objectives  MESHD010518  affects the progression of many diseases, while its detailed mechanism remains unclear. This study hopes to provide new ideas for exploring its mechanism by analyzing the  NCBIGene110006  NCBIGene110006  microbiota and fecal metabolic characteristics of experimental  MESHD010518   NCBITaxon10116  NCBITaxon10116 . Methods A total of 10  NCBITaxon10116  NCBITaxon10116  were randomly divided into ligature-induced experimental  MESHD010518  (EP) group and healthy control group. After 4 weeks of the experiment, the feces of all  NCBITaxon10116  NCBITaxon10116  were collected for sequencing through 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) sequencing technology and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Results 16S rDNA sequencing results showed that the beta-diversity of gut  NCBIGene110006  NCBIGene110006 robiota was significantly different between the EP and control group, and the levels of dominant genera were different. Compared with the control group, Rumi NCBITaxon33038  NCBITaxon33038 ch NCBITaxon562  NCBITaxon562 d Roseburia were significantly enriched in EP, and Coprococcus, Turicibacter, Lachnospira were significantly decreased. Correlation analysis showed that Roseburia exhibited the highest correlation within the genus. Of 3,488 qualitative metabolites, 164 metabolites were upregulated and 362 metabolites were downregulated in EP. Enrichment analysis showed that peri MESHD010518 nificantly changed 45 positive/negative ion metabolic pathways. Five KEGG pathways, protein digestion and absorption, tyro MESHD014443 abolism, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, niac MESHD009525  nico MESHD009536 abolism, and oxidative phosphorylation, are enriched in both the microbiome and metabolome. Correlation analysis showed that the genera with significant differences in peri MESHD010518 e usually significantly correlated with more metabolites, such as Roseburia, Lachnospira, Esch NCBITaxon562  NCBITaxon562 ricibacter, and Rumi NCBITaxon33038  NCBITaxon33038 e genera with the same changing trend tended to have a similar correlation with some certain metabolites. In addition, vita MESHD004872  prot MESHC028025 e the most significant correlations with microorganisms. Conclusion Our study reveals that peri MESHD010518 ers gut  NCBIGene110006  NCBIGene110006 robiota and fecal metabolites. The correlation analysis of microbiota and metabolome provides a deeper understanding of peri MESHD010518 d also provides a direction for the study of peri MESHD010518 ecting other diseases.

35505069	Trends of influenza vaccination coverage in pregnant women: a ten-year analysis from a French healthcare database Pregnant women have a high risk of severe influenza, associated with obstetrical complications. The World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended influenza vaccination for all pregnant women since 2012. The vaccination coverage remains low worldwide, and in Europe, due to a lack of proposition from the health care providers, and a high refusal rate from the women. The primary aim of this study was to estimate the influenza vaccination coverage (IVC) in a population of pregnant women in France, and to analyse its evolution from 2009 to 2018. The secondary objective was to describe the vaccinated population and to find determinants associated with the vaccination. This retrospective cohort study is based on the EGB French health care database, a representative sample of the French population containing data from the health insurance system. All pregnant women who delivered medically or spontaneously over the 2009-2018 period were included. In the 2009-2018 period, only 1.2% pregnant women were vaccinated against influenza (n = 875/72,207; 95% CI 1.14-1.30). The IVC slightly increased after the 2012 WHO recommendation, from 0.33 to 1.79% (p < 0.001) but remained extremely low (4.1% in 2018). Women younger than 25 years old had a low coverage (0.6%) whereas women over 35 years old were more likely to get the influenza vaccine (1.7%; OR: 2.82, 95% CI 2.14-3.71). The vaccination behavior was not influenced by multifetal pregnancy or parity, but socio-economically deprived women were less likely to be vaccinated (OR: 0.81, 95% CI: 0.67-0.98). Women with pre-existing medical conditions had an overall higher vaccination rate (2.5%; OR: 2.32, 95% CI: 1.94-2.77). The vaccine was mainly prescribed by family physicians (58%). Influenza vaccination in pregnant women in France remains very low, particularly in younger, healthy women, and measures such as information campaigns towards pregnant women and studies of the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of the health care professionals need to be undertaken to improve the coverage. 
35464058	Endocrine Regulation on Bone by Thyroid Background As an endocrine organ, the thyroid acts on the entire body by secreting a series of hormones, and bone is one of the main target organs of the thyroid. Summary This review highlights the roles of thyroid hormones and  MESHD013959  in bone homeostasis. Conclusion Thyroid hormones play significant roles in the growth and development of bone, and imbalance of thyroid hormones can impair bone homeostasis. 
35509580	Intracranial fungal  NCBITaxon89940  NCBITaxon89940   MESHD007239  in a nonimmunocompromised patient: A case report and review of the literature Background:   NCBITaxon89940  NCBITaxon89940  is a dematiaceous fungus that rarely infects the central nervous system (CNS). It is associated with a  MESHD003643  rate of over 70% despite treatment. Case Description:  An 81-year-old female with a remote history of  MESHC538614  presented with progressive  MESHD006261  and an expressive aphasia for 3 days. Computed tomography imaging revealed a left frontotemporal mass with surrounding vasogenic  MESHD004487 . A left frontotemporal craniotomy was performed and cultures revealed  NCBITaxon89940  NCBITaxon89940 . The initial management with IV  MESHD065819  was unsuccessful and the patient had a recurrence of the  MESHD007239  and developed  MESHD008169 . Following the addition of oral  MESHD005437 , the patient showed a significant improvement with a complete radiographic resolution of both the cranial and  MESHD008171 . Conclusion:   NCBITaxon89940  NCBITaxon89940  involving the CNS is a rare and often fatal disease. Surgical management along with standard antifungal treatment may not provide definitive therapy. The addition of  MESHD005437  to IV  MESHD065819  resulted in a positive outcome for this patient who is alive, living independently 1 year from the original diagnosis. In this rare fungal  MESHD007239 , standard antifungal treatment may not provide adequate coverage and the utilization of additional therapy may be required. 
35463737	Novel DLSNNC and SBS based framework for improving QoS in healthcare-IoT applications Health care system is intended to enhance one's health and as a result, one's quality of life. In order to fulfil its social commitment, health care must focus on producing social profit to sustain itself. Also, due to ever increasing demand of healthcare sector, there is  MESHD006261  in the amount of patient data that is produced and needs to be stored for long duration for clinical reference. The risk of patient data being lost due to a data centre failure can be minimized by including a  NCBIGene161882  NCBIGene161882  layer into the cloud computing architecture. Furthermore, the burden of such data produced is stored on the cloud. In order to increase service quality, we introduce  NCBIGene161882  NCBIGene161882  computing based on deep learning sigmoid-based neural network clustering (DLSNNC) and score-based scheduling (SBS).  NCBIGene161882  NCBIGene161882  computing begins by collecting and storing healthcare data on the cloud layer, using data collected through sensors. Deep learning sigmoid based neural network clustering and score based Scheduling approaches are used to determine entropy for each  NCBIGene161882  NCBIGene161882  node in the  NCBIGene161882  NCBIGene161882  layer. Sensors collect data and send it to the  NCBIGene161882  NCBIGene161882  layer, while the cloud computing tier is responsible for monitoring the healthcare system. The exploratory findings show promising results in terms of end-to-end latency and network utilization. Also, the proposed system outperforms the existing techniques in terms of average delay.  
35501846	A randomized trial of comparing video telecare education vs. in-person education on dietary regimen compliance in patients with  MESHD003924 : a support for clinical telehealth Providers Background Compliance to dietary recommendations by patients is the most difficult part of  MESHD003920  management. The nature of any educational method is to increase patients' awareness. But the question is, what is the effect of each method and for this purpose a comparative method should be considered. Therefore, this study was conducted to compare the effects of in-person education versus video tele-education on dietary regimen compliance in patients with T2DM. Methods In this trial, 378 patients with ty MESHD003924 T2DM) were random allocated into video tele-education, in-person education and control groups. The patients' weight and biochemical parameters were measured before educational programs and three-month later. Results The mean changes of patients' weight, glycemic parameters, and Lipi MESHD008055 files decreased more in the two educational groups than the control group in a three-month period. There were no significant differences in the all study variables between the in-person and video education groups in post interventions except Total Chol MESHD002784 ). The pre- and post-intervention changes in the weight, TC, hemoglobin A1c, Trig MESHD014280 d Very Low-density Lipoprotein Cholesterol were significant in both in-person group and video group. None of the educational programs had a significant impact on the Fasting blood suga MESHD000073893 w-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol, and High-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol. Discussion Video tele-education was just as effective as in-person educational method on dietary regimen compliance among patients with T2DM in a three-month period. Therefore, it is recommended to use video tele-education in combination with or as an alternative to the in-person education method. This study provides support for diabet MESHD003920 tor.

35395059	The Fim and FhaB adhesins play a crucial role in nasal cavity  MESHD007239  and Bordetella pertussis transmission in a novel  NCBITaxon10090  NCBITaxon10090  catarrhal  MESHD007239  model  MESHD012141  caused by Bordetella pertussis used to be the prime cause of infant  MESHD003643  in the pre-vaccine era and  NCBITaxon10090  NCBITaxon10090  models of  MESHD014917  served in characterization of  NCBITaxon520  NCBITaxon520  virulence mechanisms. However, the biologically most relevant  MESHD003139  stage and  NCBITaxon520  NCBITaxon520  transmission has not been adequately reproduced in adult  NCBITaxon10090  NCBITaxon10090  due to limited proliferation of the human-adapted pathogen on  NCBITaxon10090  NCBITaxon10090  nasopharyngeal mucosa. We used  MESHD007153  C57BL/6J  NCBIGene17874  NCBIGene17874  KO  NCBITaxon10090  NCBITaxon10090  to achieve  NCBITaxon520  NCBITaxon520  proliferation to human-like high counts of 108 viable bacteria per nasal cavity to elicit rhinosinusitis accompanied by robust shedding and transmission of  NCBITaxon520  NCBITaxon520  bacteria to adult co-housed  NCBIGene17874  NCBIGene17874  KO  NCBITaxon10090  NCBITaxon10090 . Experiments with a comprehensive set of  NCBITaxon520  NCBITaxon520  mutants revealed that pertussis toxin, adenylate cyclase toxin-hemolysin, the T3SS effector BteA/BopC and several other known virulence factors were dispensable for nasal cavity  MESHD007239  and  NCBITaxon520  NCBITaxon520  transmission in the immunocompromised  NCBIGene17874  NCBIGene17874  KO  NCBITaxon10090  NCBITaxon10090 . In contrast, mutants lacking the filamentous hemagglutinin (FhaB) or fimbriae (Fim) adhesins  MESHD007239  the nasal cavity poorly, shed at low levels and failed to productively infect co-housed  NCBIGene17874  NCBIGene17874  KO or C57BL/6J  NCBITaxon10090  NCBITaxon10090 . FhaB and fimbriae thus appear to play a critical role in  NCBITaxon520  NCBITaxon520  transmission. The here-described novel  NCBITaxon10090  NCBITaxon10090  model of  NCBITaxon520  NCBITaxon520 -induced  MESHD012220  the way to genetic dissection of host mechanisms involved in  NCBITaxon520  NCBITaxon520  shedding and to validation of key bacterial transmission factors that ought to be targeted by future pertussis vaccines. Author summary Pertussis is a strictly human  MESHD012141  that can be fatal to young children and elderly. The currently used  NCBITaxon10090  NCBITaxon10090  models of  MESHD002543  or pulmonary B.  MESHD014917  served remarkably well in identification of  NCBITaxon520  NCBITaxon520  virulence factors and development of efficacious pertussis vaccines. However,  NCBITaxon520  NCBITaxon520  transmission could not be reproduced in adult  NCBITaxon10090  NCBITaxon10090  due to limited proliferation of the human pathogen in the upper airways of  NCBITaxon10090  NCBITaxon10090 . Therefore, we inoculated nasal cavities of  MESHD007153   NCBIGene17874  NCBIGene17874  knock-out  NCBITaxon10090  NCBITaxon10090  to achieve a human-like high level of  MESHD007239 . This allowed triggering of  MESHD012220  and catarrhal shedding of bacteria from  NCBITaxon10090  NCBITaxon10090  nasal cavity and efficient transmission of the  MESHD007239  onto co-housed adult animals. Testing a set of bacterial mutants, we identified two bacterial adhesins as key transmission factors. Combined with the power of  NCBITaxon10090  NCBITaxon10090  and bacterial genetics, this newly established  NCBITaxon10090  NCBITaxon10090  model of the catarrhal phase of the whooping  MESHD003371  will enable deciphering of mechanisms that underlie  NCBITaxon520  NCBITaxon520  transmission to new hosts. 
35501713	A tutorial on the case time series design for small-area analysis Background The increased availability of data on health outcomes and risk factors collected at fine geographical resolution is one of the main reasons for the rising popularity of epidemiological analyses conducted at small-area level. However, this rich data setting poses important methodological issues related to modelling complexities and computational demands, as well as the linkage and harmonisation of data collected at different geographical levels. Methods This tutorial illustrated the extension of the case time series design, originally proposed for individual-level analyses on short-term associations with time-varying exposures, for applications using data aggregated over small geographical areas. The case time series design embeds the longitudinal structure of time series data within the self-matched framework of case-only methods, offering a flexible and highly adaptable analytical tool. The methodology is well suited for modelling complex temporal relationships, and it provides an efficient computational scheme for large datasets including longitudinal measurements collected at a fine geographical level. Results The application of the case time series for small-area analyses is demonstrated using a real-data case study to assess the  MESHD003643  risks associated with high temperature in the summers of 2006 and 2013 in London, UK. The example makes use of information on individual  MESHD003643 , temperature, and socio-economic characteristics collected at different geographical levels. The tutorial describes the various steps of the analysis, namely the definition of the case time series structure and the linkage of the data, as well as the estimation of the risk associations and the assessment of vulnerability differences. R code and data are made available to fully reproduce the results and the graphical descriptions. Conclusions The extension of the case time series for small-area analysis offers a valuable analytical tool that combines modelling flexibility and computational efficiency. The increasing availability of data collected at fine geographical scales provides opportunities for its application to address a wide range of epidemiological questions. 
35427167	Dissipation-enabled hydrodynamic conductivity in a tunable bandgap semiconductor Electronic transport in the regime where carrier-carrier collisions are the dominant scattering mechanism has taken on new relevance with the advent of ultraclean two-dimensional materials. Here, we present a combined theoretical and experimental study of ambipolar hydrodynamic transport in bilayer  MESHD006108  demonstrating that the conductivity is given by the sum of two Drude-like terms that describe relative motion between electrons and holes, and the collective motion of the electron-hole plasma. As predicted, the measured conductivity of gapless, charge-neutral bilayer  MESHD006108  is sample- and temperature-independent over a wide range. Away from neutrality, the electron-hole conductivity collapses to a single curve, and a set of just four fitting parameters provides quantitative agreement between theory and experiment at all densities, temperatures, and gaps measured. This work validates recent theories for dissipation-enabled hydrodynamic conductivity and creates a link between semiconductor physics and the emerging field of viscous electronics. Theoretical and experimental studies of electron-hole friction limited transport in bilayer  MESHD006108  with a tunable bandgap. 
35501339	Correlates of the country differences in the  MESHD007239  and  MESHD003643  rates during the first wave of the  MESHC000657245  pandemic: evidence from Bayesian model averaging The  MESHC000657245  pandemic resulted in great discrepancies in both  MESHD007239  and  MESHD003643  rates between countries. Besides the biological and epidemiological factors, a multitude of social and economic criteria also influenced the extent to which these discrepancies appeared. Consequently, there is an active debate regarding the critical socio-economic and health factors that correlate with the  MESHD007239  and  MESHD003643  rates outcome of the pandemic. Here, we leverage Bayesian model averaging techniques and country level data to investigate whether 28 variables, which describe a diverse set of health and socio-economic characteristics, correlate with the final number of  MESHD007239  and  MESHD003643  during the first wave of the  NCBITaxon11118  NCBITaxon11118  pandemic. We show that only a few variables are able to robustly correlate with these outcomes. To understand the relationship between the potential correlates in explaining the  MESHD007239  and  MESHD003643  rates, we create a  MESHD007592  Space. Using this space, we conclude that the extent to which each variable is able to provide a credible explanation for the  MESHC000657245   MESHD007239 / MESHD003643  outcome varies between countries because of their heterogeneous features. 
35428788	Near infra-red labelling and tracking of corneal endothelial cells in-vivo Following corneal transplantation, there is an initial, rapid decline in corneal endothelial cells (CECs) following surgery. Direct imaging of post-transplantation endothelial cells is only possible weeks after surgery and with a limited field of view. We have developed a labelling approach using 1,1'-dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3'-tetramethylindotricarbocyanine iodide (DIR) dye solution, that enables tracking of labelled CECs in vivo for at least 1 month. Initial in vitro optimization, with assessments of dye concentration on fluorescence, cellular  MESHD064420  and cell migration, performed in propagated primary CECs. Subsequently, in vivo evaluation of cellular labelling was assessed within a rabbit wound healing model. Finally, real-time visualization of human cadaver donor tissue incubated in DIR transplanted into  NCBITaxon9986  NCBITaxon9986  was achieved using a clinical confocal microscope. Results revealed detectable fluorescence increased with concentration to a plateau of 100 microg/ml, with no  MESHD064420  at any concentration evaluated. DIR-labelled CECs were detectable in vivo up to 1 month, and transplanted labelled donor graft could be visualized and were trackable in vivo. Acute endothelial rejection in 1 rabbit was evidenced by detectable DIR positive cells within the anterior chamber. DIR imaging allowed for detailed imaging of the transplanted human corneal endothelium, and enabled non-invasive observation of the corneal endothelial morphology following transplantation. 
35462638	Gratitude for Categories of Needs Before and During the  MESHC000657245  Pandemic This naturalistic observation study investigated the influence of broad societal events such as the  MESHC000657245  pandemic on public expressions of gratitude. Spontaneously produced gratitude expressions posted by individuals (N = 159) in an online discussion forum were extracted at three time periods (during the pandemic, one year pre-pandemic, and 2 years pre-pandemic). The gratitude expressions were coded for the categories of  MESHD007153  and growth needs based on Maslow's Theory of Motivation. The results demonstrate a higher frequency of gratitude expressions for growth opportunities during the  MESHC000657245  pandemic compared to 2 years prior. The results also demonstrate a higher frequency of gratitude for the fulfillment of  MESHD007153  needs compared to growth needs within each of the years, highlighting the overall salience of this category. These findings reveal the capacity of broad societal events to impact public gratitude expressions for needs fulfilment, which has implications for policies and programs intended to meet needs during a global crisis. 
35510142	Contemporary use and outcomes of radiation and chemotherapy for unresectable  MESHD010190  Highlights This study examines 5,624 patients with unresectable  MESHD010190 . Across "real-world" US practice, overall use of radiation treatment (RT) has declined. Among those receiving RT, stereotactic body radiation treatment (SBRT) increased. Contemporary risks of gast MESHD005767 er SBRT have decreased. Background We assessed radiation treatment (RT) use and complications for unresectable panc MESHD010190 the US, comparing conventionally fractionated (CFRT) and stereotactic body radiation treatment (SBRT) to inform real-world expected outcomes and practice. Material and Methods We analyzed 5,624 patients with non-metastatic, unresectable panc MESHD010190 522 older patients age > 65, diagnosed 2006-2013 in Medicare linked data; and 3,102 younger patients age < 65, diagnosed 2006-2016 in MarketScan data), comparing CFRT vs. SBRT vs. chemotherapy alone. Cochran-Armitage tested temporal trends. Fisher's Exact Test and proportional hazards models compared gast NCBIGene2770  NCBIGene2770   NCBIGene2770  NCBIGene2770 mplications. Healthcare payments (Consumer Price Index adjusted to 2015) through 12 months were compared using generalized linear regression models with log link and gamma distribution. Results RT use declined from 55% to 45% of older patients (2006-2013) and 52% to 47% of younger patients (2006-2016) (Ptrend < 0.001 both). Among RT patients, SBRT use increased to 10% of older patients and 12% of younger patients in the most recent years (Ptrend = 0.04 and < 0.001 respectively). Addition of RT was associated with more frequent GI bleeds, stri MESHD006470 nd fistulas (Delta= +3% to 9% excess events, all P <= 0.05). Temporal patterns suggested decreasing complications over time (Ptrend = 0.05 and 0.05 for older and younger patients). Among younger patients, there was no difference in GI complication NCBIGene2770  NCBIGene2770 for SBRT vs. CFRT (P > 0.05, all comparisons). Among older patients, increased complications were seen for SBRT in 1-4 fractions vs. CFRT (P < 0.05), but not SBRT in 5 fractions (P = 0.72). Healthcare payments were greatest for SBRT when compared with CFRT or chemotherapy under US Medicare (P < 0.001) and employer-based insurance (P < 0.001). Conclusion Real-world treatment has shifted toward more selectivity for RT in unresectable pancreatic cancer. However, SBRT uptake an MESHD010190 s in complications profiles represent opportunities to optimize current use and benefit. Findings are applicable to inform future comparative and cost effectiveness models of RT for this disease. 
35474647	The role of pharmacists in providing immunization to the general population: Are Lebanese pharmacists ready for this role? Background: Vaccination rates remain suboptimal in multiple areas around the world in spite of evidence that immunization is one of the most effective interventions for precluding morbidity and  MESHD003643 . Non-traditional vaccine providers are proposed to augment immunization coverage. Pharmacists can have multiple vital roles to educate, facilitate and immunize against vaccine-preventable diseases. Limited data are available around the expertise and practices of Lebanese pharmacists in providing immunization services. Objective: This study aimed to determine predictors that are associated with vaccine administration by pharmacists in Lebanon, and to assess experiences and practices in providing immunization. Methods: This is a cross-sectional study that included pharmacists from all over Lebanon. A web-based self-administered validated questionnaire was adapted with permission. A snowball sampling technique was used to collect data through an electronic self-administered questionnaire between March and June 2021. The web-link to the survey was also shared by the Order of Pharmacists of Lebanon with all registered pharmacists to gather a sample from different districts all over Lebanon. Results: A total of 315 pharmacists were included. A significant positive association was found between completion of an immunization training program (ORa = 2.085, [95%CI 1.006:4.322], P = 0.048), full-time pharmacists (ORa = 2.504, [95%CI 1.156:5.426], P = 0.02), 1 to 4 years of practice experience (ORa = 3.855, [95%CI 1.849:8.039], P < 0.0001), geographic area of practice (ORa = 3.201, [95%CI 1.242:8.249], P = 0.016; ORa = 5.373, [95%CI 1.859:15.530], P = 0.002 for Beirut and Mount Lebanon respectively), educating the public about immunization (ORa = 3.012, [95%CI 1.281:7.083], P = 0.011); and vaccine administration. Conclusion: The study highlights the need for additional immunization training programs to pharmacists to expand their ability and role as immunizers. It also provides intuition for policy makers to upgrade legislation relating to pharmacy continuing education and immunization training in order to enable pharmacists to have a greater role in direct vaccination. 
35521587	Aggregation induced emission by pyridinium-pyridinium interactions  Non-covalent intermolecular interactions between pyridinium subunits in a crystal-state are an efficient means to accomplish aggregation induced emission and avoid aggregation caused quenching. Non-covalent intermolecular pyridinium-pyridinium and pyridinium-arene-pi system interactions result in aggregation induced emission (AIE). 
35498703	Untargeted Metabolomics Sheds Light on the Diversity of Major Classes of Secondary Metabolites in the Malpighiaceae Botanical Family Natural products produced by plants are one of the most investigated natural sources, which substantially contributed to the development of the natural products field. Even though these compounds are widely explored, the literature still lacks comprehensive investigations aiming to explore the evolution of secondary metabolites produced by plants, especially if classical methodologies are employed. The development of sensitive hyphenated techniques and computational tools for data processing has enabled the study of large datasets, being valuable assets for chemosystematic studies. Here, we describe a strategy for chemotaxonomic investigations using the Malpighiaceae botanical family as a model. Our workflow was based on MS/MS untargeted metabolomics, spectral searches, and recently described in silico classification tools, which were mapped into the latest molecular phylogeny accepted for this family. The metabolomic analysis revealed that different ionization modes and extraction protocols significantly impacted the chemical profiles, influencing the chemotaxonomic results. Spectral searches within public databases revealed several clades or genera-specific molecular families, being potential chemical markers for these taxa, while the in silico classification tools were able to expand the Malpighiaceae chemical space. The classes putatively annotated were used for ancestral character reconstructions, which recovered several classes of metabolites as homoplasies (i.e., non-exclusive) or synapomorphies (i.e., exclusive) for all sampled clades and genera. Our workflow combines several approaches to perform a comprehensive evolutionary chemical study. We expect it to be used on further chemotaxonomic investigations to expand chemical knowledge and reveal biological insights for compounds classes in different biological groups. 
35494688	Excellent performance of aromatic polyguanamines induced by multiple  MESHD006859  bondable tetraazacalix[2]arene[2]-triazine ring in their main chain  A series of poly(guanamine) (c-PG)s containing tetraazacalix[2]arene[2]-triazine (mPDA2CyC2) were successfully prepared by solution polycondensation of mPDA2CyC2 with various aromatic diamines in an aprotic organic solvent with a li MESHD018021 dditive (5 wt%) at 150  C for 6 hours. The number-average molecular weights (Mn)s of these c-PG polymers reached up to 31 500, with a relatively broad molecular weight distribution (Mw/Mn) of 5.3. They showed good solubility in aprotic organic solvents, such as N- MESHC038678 nd N, MESHC013959 t a concentration of 2 mg mL-1. The glass transition temperatures (Tg) of the c- MESHD002244 G po MESHD011108 ere in the range 359  C-392  C, approximately 160  C higher than those of counterpart po MESHD011108 i.e., with no aza-calixarene-based PG (l-PG)). The coefficients of thermal expansion (CTEs) of the c- MESHD002244 G polymers were 29.7-48.1 ppm K-1 (at 100  C-150  C), much lower than those of l-PG samples, i.e., 59.1-85.1 ppm K-1. Transparent and almost colorless c-PG films were successfully prepared by a solution casting method, showing maximum tensile strength (sigmaS), modulus (Egamma), and elongation at break (Eb) values of 151 MPa, 6.3 GPa, and 4.4%, respectively, for the c-PG polymer from mPDA2CyC2 and 4, MESHC015126 onomers. The corresponding l-PG film exhibited sigmaS, Egamma, and Eb values of just 76 MPa, 5.4 GPa, and 1.6%, respectively. These outstanding thermal and mechanical properties of the c-PG polymers can be attributed to their multiple hy MESHD006859 onding interaction between mPDA2CyC2 residues in the po MESHD011108 ackbone. This interaction was identified by infrared spectroscopy measurements at the broad absorption band around 3000-3400 cm-1.

35494547	Active Stabilization of Interventional Tasks Utilizing a Magnetically Manipulated Endoscope Magnetically actuated robots have become increasingly popular in medical endoscopy over the past decade. Despite the significant improvements in autonomy and control methods, progress within the field of medical magnetic endoscopes has mainly been in the domain of enhanced navigation. Interventional tasks such as biopsy, polyp removal, and clip placement are a major procedural component of endoscopy. Little advancement has been done in this area due to the problem of adequately controlling and stabilizing magnetically actuated endoscopes for interventional tasks. In the present paper we discuss a novel model-based Linear Parameter Varying (LPV) control approach to provide stability during interventional maneuvers. This method linearizes the non-linear dynamic interaction between the external actuation system and the endoscope in a set of equilibria, associated to different distances between the magnetic source and the endoscope, and computes different controllers for each equilibrium. This approach provides the global stability of the overall system and robustness against external disturbances. The performance of the LPV approach is compared to an intelligent teleoperation control method (based on a Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) controller), on the Magnetic Flexible Endoscope (MFE) platform. Four biopsies in different regions of the colon and at two different system equilibria are performed. Both controllers are asked to stabilize the endoscope in the presence of external disturbances (i.e. the introduction of the biopsy forceps through the working channel of the endoscope). The experiments, performed in a benchtop colon simulator, show a maximum reduction of the mean orientation error of the endoscope of 45.8% with the LPV control compared to the PID controller.

35520678	A dual-mode resonance Rayleigh scattering and colorimetric  NCBIGene250  NCBIGene250  assay based on in situ  MESHD001205 -induced signal generation from  MESHC016552  nanosheets  Multimode sensing has attracted extensive attention because they provide more than one transduction channel, thus improving accuracy and sensitivity. Due to the structural diversity, MnO2 nanosheets and nanoneedles were successively obtained via one-step redox reaction and different self-assembly methods. MnO2 nanosheets possess outstanding optical properties including extremely strong resonance Rayleigh scattering (RRS) and absorbance signal, and were selected as a dual-mode sensing material. Inspired by the selectivity of al NCBIGene250  NCBIGene250 AL NCBIGene250  NCBIGene250 towards dephosphorylate as MESHC011669 AA MESHC011669 to generate as MESHD001205 AA), which has the ability to decompose MnO2 nanosheets along with optical signals and colour change, a dual-mode optical AL NCBIGene250  NCBIGene250 ensing platform has been designed. Therefore, MnO2 nanosheets can serve as colorimetric probes by directly visualizing the colour variation with bare eyes. Moreover, the detection limit obtained by the RRS sensing mode can be as low as 0.17 mU L-1, which is far superior to that obtained by previously reported methods. The strategy not only has good feasibility and sensitivity, but also shows good prospects for a series of AL NCBIGene250  NCBIGene250 xtended sensing applications. Multimode sensing has attracted extensive attention because they provide more than one transduction channel, thus improving accuracy and sensitivity. 
35515049	Ultrasensitive specific sensor based on all-dielectric metasurfaces in the terahertz range An ultrasensitive specific sensor based on all-dielectric metasurfaces in the terahertz range was proposed. The designed metasurfaces consist of multi pairs of tilted  MESHD012825  bars on a SiO2 substrate with a high-Q Fano resonance feature. The peak of this high Q Fano resonance can form a wide reflection spectrum band by scanning the angle of the incident THz waves. Utilizing this angle-scanning strategy, we designed a metasurface sensor and its reflection spectrum band can cover the absorption peak of  MESHD014443  and  MESHD012500 . By depositing different thicknesses of  MESHD014443  and  MESHD012500  on the sensor, we have successfully identified them with a detection limit of 6.7 mug cm-2 and 59.35 mug cm-2, respectively. The performance of the sensor with high sensitivity has been analyzed in detail, showing an exciting prospect for identification of 'fingerprint' spectra in the terahertz region. An ultrasensitive specific sensor based on all-dielectric metasurfaces in the terahertz range was proposed. 
35514367	Enhancing the stability of the  MESHD012238 / MESHD015034  catalyst by the growth of ZIF-8 for the hydroformylation of higher  MESHD000475   Hydroformylation of ol MESHD000475 s one of the most important industrial processes for al MESHD000447 roduction. Therein, the leaching of active metals for heterogeneous catalysts is an important issue in the hydroformylation reaction, particularly for higher ol MESHD000475 o produce higher al MESHD000438 Here, different Rh MESHD012238 n MESHD015034 atalysts with diverse Zn MESHD015034 s a support were investigated and a home-made ZnO50 support was selected to prepare the Rh/ZnO50@ZIF-8 core-shell structure catalyst, which was synthesized by the growth of ZIF-8 with ZnO50 as the sacrificed template to afford Zn MESHD015032 ource. Compared with the Rh/ZnO50 catalyst, the Rh/ZnO50@ZIF-8 catalyst demonstrated a better cyclic stability in the hydroformylation of 1-dodecene. Combining the experiment and characterization results, it was concluded that the ZIF-8 shell on the Rh/ZnO50 catalyst effectively prevented the leaching of metal Rh into the reaction solution. Moreover, the Rh/ZnO50@ZIF-8 catalyst exhibited good universality for other higher ol MESHD000475 This work provides a useful guideline for immobilizing the active species in heterogeneous catalysts for the hydroformylation reaction. The stability of the Rh/Z MESHD012238   MESHD015034 alyst in the hydroformylation of 1-dodecene obviously improved, which was attributed to that the ZIF-8 shell on the Rh/Z MESHD012238   MESHD015034 alyst effectively prevented the leaching of meta MESHD008670  
35517931	 MESHD010165  nanoparticles embedded in mesoporous carbons as efficient, green and reusable catalysts for mild hydrogenations of nitroarenes  The reduction of nitroarenes is the most efficient route for the preparation of aromatic primary am MESHD000588 These reductions are generally performed in the presence of heterogeneous tr MESHD028561 atalysts, which are rather efficient but long and tedious to prepare. In addition, they contain very expensive metals that are in most cases difficult to reuse. Therefore, the development of efficient, easily accessible and reusable Pd MESHD010165 atalysts obtained rapidly from safe and non-toxic starting materials was implemented in this report. Two bottom-up synthesis methods were used, the first consisted in the impregnation of a micro/mesoporous ca MESHD002244 upport with a Pd salt solution, followed by thermal reduction (at 300, 450 or 600  C) while the second involved a direct synthesis based on the co-assembly and pyrolysis (600  C) of a mixture of a phenolic precursor, gl MESHD006037 a surfactant and a Pd salt. The obtained composites possess Pd MESHD010165 anoparticles (NPs) of tunable sizes (ranging from 1-2 to 7.0 nm) and homogeneously distributed in the ca MESHD002244 ramework (pores/walls). It turned out that they were successfully used for mild and environment-friendly hydrogenations of nitroarenes at room temperature under H2 MESHD003903 1 atm) in Et MESHD000431 n the presence of only 5 mequiv. of supported Pd. The determinations of the optimal characteristics of the catalysts constituted a second objective of this study. It was found that the activity of the catalysts was strongly dependent on the Pd NPs sizes, i.e., catalysts bearing small Pd NPs (1.2 nm obtained at 300  C and 3.4 nm obtained at 450  C) exhibited an excellent activity, while those containing larger Pd NPs (6.4 nm and 7.0 nm obtained at 600  C, either by indirect or direct methods) were not active. Moreover, the possibility to reuse the catalysts was shown to be dependent on the surface chemistry of the Pd NPs: the smallest Pd NPs are prone to oxidation by air and their surface was gradually covered by a PdO shell decreasing their activity during reuse. A good compromise between intrinsic catalytic activity (i.e. during first use) and possibility of reuse was found in the catalyst made by impregnation followed by reduction at 450  C since the hydrogenation could be performed in only 2 h in Et MESHD000431 r even in wa MESHD014867 The catalyst was quantitatively recovered after reaction by filtration, used at least 7 times with no loss of efficiency. Advantageously, almost Pd MESHD010165 ree primary aromatic amines were obtained since the Pd MESHD010165 eaching was very low (<0.1% of the introduced amount). Compared to numerous reports from the literature, the catalysts described here were both easily accessible from eco-friendly precursors and very active for hydrogenations under mild and "green" reaction conditions. Size induced activity and reusability of mesoporous carbons containing Pd NPs are dem MESHD010165 strated herein for mild and green hydrogenations of nitroarenes. 
35495577	The tricuspid annulus in  MESHD000686  with cardiac involvement: Detailed analysis from the three-dimensional speckle tracking echocardiographic MAGYAR-Path Study Introduction  MESHD000686  is a rare condition due to extracellular deposition of excessive amount of protein in parenchymal tissues including the heart. The present study aimed to test whether  MESHD006331  (CA) is associated with morphological and  OMIM614822  (TA). For this aim, the results of patients having CA were compared to age- and gender-matched healthy controls by three-dimensional speckle-tracking echocardiography (3DSTE). Moreover, differences in TA parameters between light-chain CA (AL-CA) and transthyretin CA ( NCBIGene7276  NCBIGene7276 -CA) were studies as well. Materials and Methods The study comprised 27 CA patients (mean age: 62.7 +- 9.1 years, 21 males), their results were compared to those of 20 age- and gender-matched healthy volunteers (59.3 +- 3.8 years, 13 males). Complete two-dimensional Doppler echocardiography and 3DSTE were performed in all CA patients and controls. Results Dilated end-diastolic and end-systolic TA diameter, area and perimeter could be detected in all CA patients and in the AL-CA and TTR-CA subgr NCBIGene7276  NCBIGene7276 s, as well. Although only a few TTR-CA patie NCBIGene7276  NCBIGene7276  were involved, morphologic TA parameters proved to be tendentiously higher as compared to those of AL-CA patients. Functional parameters of TA were found to be reduced in CA patients, which were more deteriorated in AL-CA patients. Conclusions Dilated TA is associated with its functional deterioration in CA.

35497962	Antimicrobial resistance: One Health approach In this research, a review of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is conducted as part of the One Health approach. A review of publications, which included "antimicrobial resistance" and "One Health," was conducted. Among the global health problems, AMR is the one that most clearly illustrates the One Health approach. AMR is a critical global problem affecting humans, the environment, and animals. This is related to each of these three components due to the irresponsible and excessive use of antimicrobials in various sectors (agriculture, livestock, and human medicine). Improper management of antimicrobials, inadequate control of  MESHD007239 , agricultural debris, pollutants in the environment, and migration of people and animals  MESHD007239  with resistant bacteria facilitate the spread of resistance. The study aimed to analyze the problem of AMR from a health perspective to analyze the different actors involved in One Health.

The escalating outspread of the virus and rapid rise in the number of cases require the instantaneous development of effectual drugs and vaccines. Presently, there are no approved drugs or vaccine available to treat the  MESHD007239 . In such scenario, one of the propitious therapeutic approaches against  MESHD001102  is to explore enzyme inhibitors amidst natural compounds, utilizing computational approaches aiming to get products with negligible side effects. In the present study, the inhibitory prospects of ilimaquinone (marine sponge metabolite) were assessed in comparison with hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, favipiravir, ivermectin and  MESHC000606551  at the active binding pockets of nine different vital  NCBITaxon2697049  NCBITaxon2697049  target proteins (spike receptor binding domain, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase,  NCBIGene43740578  NCBIGene43740578 , Nsp13, Nsp14, Nsp15, Nsp16, main protease, and papain-like-protease), employing an in silico molecular interaction based approach. In addition, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the  NCBITaxon2697049  NCBITaxon2697049  papain-like protease ( NCBIGene43740578  NCBIGene43740578 )- MESHC467077  complex were also carried out to calculate various structural parameters including root mean square fluctuation (RMSF), root mean square deviation (RMSD), radius of gyration (Rg) and  MESHD006859  bond interactions.  NCBIGene43740578  NCBIGene43740578  is a promising drug target, due to its imperative role in viral replication and additional function of stripping ubiquitin and interferon-stimulated gene 15 ( NCBIGene9636  NCBIGene9636 ) from host-cell proteins. In light of the possible inhibition of all vital  NCBITaxon2697049  NCBITaxon2697049  target proteins, our study has emphasized the importance to study in depth  MESHC467077  actions in vivo.

35509758	A Rare Case of Esophageal  MESHD007971  Esophageal  MESHD007971  refers to a clinical finding of a white patch on the mucous membrane surface that cannot be scraped off. It has been associated with  MESHD000438  and  NCBITaxon4097  NCBITaxon4097  use and chronic acid reflux. An association with  MESHD002294  and  MESHD009369  has been reported with potential for malignant transformation warranting endoscopic intervention or surveillance, but no guidelines exist. We present a case of a 77-year-old female with a history of longstanding a MESHD004931 requiring multiple Botox injections. After presenting with w MESHD015431  e MESHD003680  and acid reflux the patient underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) showing a NCBIGene28935  NCBIGene28935 mm white plaque in the middle third of the esophagus and histopathology consistent with e MESHD007971  After repeated Botox injection and treatment with PPI and H2 blocker, no findings of esophageal l MESHD007971 were noted on repeat EGD. With this case, we aim to increase awareness of this rare disease pathology, especially in the setting of underlying a MESHD004931  This case also raises the question if maximum anti-reflux therapy could have a potential benefit in avoiding the recurrence of e MESHD007971  
35365626	 NCBIGene7398  NCBIGene7398 -trapping lesions as a source of DNA replication  MESHD000079225  and genomic instability The deubiquitinase  NCBIGene7398  NCBIGene7398  is a critical regulator of genome integrity through the deubiquitylation of  MESHD005199  and the DNA replication processivity factor,  NCBIGene5111  NCBIGene5111  ( NCBIGene5111  NCBIGene5111 ). Uniquely, following UV irradiation,  NCBIGene7398  NCBIGene7398  self-inactivates through autocleavage, which enables its own degradation and in turn, upregulates  NCBIGene5111  NCBIGene5111  monoubiquitylation. However, the functional role for this autocleavage event during physiological conditions remains elusive. Herein, we discover that cells harboring an autocleavage-defective  NCBIGene7398  NCBIGene7398  mutant, while still able to robustly deubiquitylate  NCBIGene5111  NCBIGene5111 , experience more replication fork-stalling and premature fork termination events. Using super-resolution microscopy and live-cell single-molecule tracking, we show that these defects are related to the inability of this  NCBIGene7398  NCBIGene7398  mutant to be properly recycled from sites of active DNA synthesis, resulting in replication-associated lesions. Furthermore, we find that the removal of  NCBIGene7398  NCBIGene7398  molecules from DNA is facilitated by the DNA-dependent metalloprotease Spartan to counteract the  MESHD064420  caused by " NCBIGene7398  NCBIGene7398 -trapping". We propose a utility of  NCBIGene7398  NCBIGene7398  inhibitors in  MESHD009369  therapy based on their ability to induce  NCBIGene7398  NCBIGene7398 -trapping lesions and consequent replication  MESHD000079225  and genomic instability in  MESHD009369  cells, similar to how non-covalent DNA-protein crosslinks cause  MESHD064420  by imposing steric hindrances upon proteins involved in DNA transactions. Here the authors provide mechanistic insights into how auto-cleavage of the USP1 NCBIGene7398  NCBIGene7398 biquitinase regulates DNA replication and genome stability. Implications for the targeting of USP1 NCBIGene7398  NCBIGene7398 ivity via protein-DNA trapping in canc MESHD009369 rapy are discussed. 
35361081	The efficacy and safety of  MESHD014148  in lumbar surgery: A meta-analysis of randomized-controlled trials Objectives  This meta-analysis aims to assess  MESHD014148  ( MESHD014148 ) effectiveness and safety in lumbar surgery. Patients and methods  Renewals of randomized-controlled trials (RCTs) were conducted utilizing databases of medical literature such as PubMed, China Science and Technology Journal Database, Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and EMBASE to compare principal and safety endpoints. The risk ratio (RR), standard mean difference (SMD), and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. For the evaluation of the quality of the included studies, the Cochrane risk of bias criteria were utilized by two authors. Results  In total, 49 articles were enrolled that included 4,822 patients. Of the patients, 2,653 were administered  MESHD014148  and 2,169 were in the control group. The findings indicated that  MESHD014148  was capable of significantly lowering  MESHD019106  (PBL), transfusion rate, transfusion volume, total  MESHD006473  (TBL),  MESHD016063  (IBL), and drainage compared to the control group. Besides, hemoglobin (Hb) and hematocrit (Hct) values were higher in the  MESHD014148  group compared to the control group. As the safety endpoints,  MESHD014148  significantly reduced D-dimer levels compared to the control group; however, both  MESHD014148  and control groups had no significant variations in  MESHD020246  (DVT). Subgroup analysis was administrated according to the administration method of  MESHD014148  and the operation type and intravenous and topical  MESHD014148  were combined in the meta-analysis. Conclusion  This meta-analysis showed that  MESHD014148  had the potential to significantly lower PBL, transfusion rate, transfusion volume, TBL, IBL, and drainage compared to the control group. Besides, Hb and Hct values were higher in the  MESHD014148  group compared to the control group. Its hemostatic potential after lumbar spine surgery is trustworthy. It is still controversial in safety endpoints that  MESHD014148  can significantly reduce D-dimer compared to the control group, without no significant variations in DVT in both the  MESHD014148  and control groups. 
35404122	Inferring Species Compositions of Complex Fungal Communities from Long- and Short-Read Sequence Data ABSTRACT The kingdom Fungi is highly diverse in morphology and ecosystem function. Yet fungi are challenging to characterize as they can be difficult to culture and morphologically indistinct. Overall, their description and analysis lag far behind other microbes such as bacteria. Classification of species via high-throughput sequencing is increasingly becoming the norm for pathogen detection, microbiome studies, and  NCBITaxon1275957  NCBITaxon1275957  monitoring. With the rapid development of sequencing technologies, however, standardized procedures for taxonomic assignment of long sequence reads have not yet been well established. Focusing on nanopore sequencing technology, we compared classification and community composition analysis pipelines using shotgun and amplicon sequencing data generated from mock communities comprising 43 fungal species. We show that regardless of the sequencing methodology used, the highest accuracy of species identification was achieved by sequence alignment against a fungal-specific database. During the assessment of classification algorithms, we found that applying cutoffs to the query coverage of each read or contig significantly improved the classification accuracy and community composition analysis without major data loss. We also generated draft genome assemblies for three fungal species from nanopore data which were absent from genome databases. Our study improves sequence-based classification and estimation of relative sequence abundance using real fungal community data and provides a practical guide for the design of metagenomics analyses focusing on fungi. 
35454103	 MESHD003474  and  MESHD000431  Effects in Trembler-J Schwann Cell Culture  MESHD000699  is the most common progressive human motor and  MESHD010523 .  CVCLX218  type 1E is a  MESHD003711  affecting Schwann cells due to  NCBIGene18858  NCBIGene18858  ( NCBIGene18858  NCBIGene18858 ) mutations, modelized by Trembler-J  NCBITaxon10090  NCBITaxon10090 .  MESHD003474 , a natural  MESHD059808  compound obtained from  NCBITaxon136217  NCBITaxon136217  ( NCBITaxon136217  NCBITaxon136217 ), exhibits dose- and time-varying antitumor, antioxidant and neuroprotective properties, however, the neurotherapeutic actions of  MESHD003474  remain elusive. Here, we propose  MESHD003474  as a possible natural treatment capable of enhancing cellular detoxification mechanisms, resulting in an improvement of the neurodegenerative Trembler-J phenotype. Using a refined method for obtaining enriched Schwann cell cultures, we evaluated the neurotherapeutic action of low dose  MESHD003474  treatment on the  NCBIGene5376  NCBIGene5376  expression, and on the chaperones and  NCBIGene56717  NCBIGene56717  ( NCBIGene2475  NCBIGene2475 ) pathways in Trembler-J and wild-type genotypes. In wild-type Schwann cells, the action of  MESHD003474  resulted in strong stimulation of the chaperone and macroautophagy pathway, whereas the modulation of ribophagy showed a mild effect. However, despite the promising neuroprotective effects for the treatment of  MESHD020271 , we demonstrate that the action of  MESHD003474  in  Focus10090  could be impaired due to the irreversible impact of  MESHD000431  used as a common  MESHD003474  vehicle necessary for administration. These results contribute to expanding our still limited understanding of  NCBIGene5376  NCBIGene5376  biology in neurobiology and expose the intrinsic lability of the neurodegenerative Trembler-J genotype. Furthermore, they unravel interesting physiological mechanisms of cellular resilience relevant to the pharmacological treatment of the neurodegenerative Tremble J phenotype with  MESHD003474  and  MESHD000431 . We conclude that the analysis of the effects of the vehicle itself is an essential and inescapable step to comprehensibly assess the effects and full potential of  MESHD003474  treatment for therapeutic purposes. 
35474822	Multifunctional Hemostatic PVA/Chitosan Sponges Loaded with  MESHD017886  and  MESHD002939  The present study describes the development of multifunctional hemostatic sponges to control  MESHD006470 .  MESHD048271  (Ch) and  MESHD011142  ( MESHD011142 ) were selected as the basic polymeric matrix [Ch/PVA] for sponges.  MESHD005990  and  MESHD019343  were used as crosslinkers [Ch/PVA/G(Cl)] to enhance the mechanical properties of the developed sponges.  MESHD002939  (AB) was added to the developed sponge to impart antibacterial activity.  MESHD017886  ( MESHD017886 ) was also added, which would make the sponge suitable for bone surgery. Among the developed sponges, the Ch/PVA/G(Cl)-HA-AB sponge demonstrated enhanced cell viability, mechanical properties, and strong antimicrobial effect against  NCBITaxon562  NCBITaxon562 ,  NCBITaxon287  NCBITaxon287 , and  NCBITaxon1280  NCBITaxon1280 , in addition to  MESHD001791  activity. The addition of  MESHD002939  and  MESHD017886  promotes a unique synergistic effect of antimicrobial activity and hemostasis. Thus, the present study introduces Ch/PVA/G(Cl)-HA-AB, a multifunctional hemostatic sponge that would be suitable for bone surgical applications. 
35454475	Complicated Structure Change during Capillary Extrusion of Binary Blends of Polycarbonate and  MESHD019904  The effects of pressure and shear rate on the miscibility of binary blends comprising  MESHC028237  ( NCBIGene5091  NCBIGene5091 ) and low molecular weight poly(methyl methacrylate) ( MESHD019904 ) were investigated using a capillary rheometer. Both pressure and shear rate affected the miscibility. The examination of an extruded strand of the blend provided information about the cause of the phase change. Under high pressure, pressure-induced demixing occurred at temperatures below the lower critical solution temperature (LCST) of the blend. Consequently, the extruded strand became opaque throughout. During shear-induced mixing/demixing, a part of the strand became opaque because of the distribution of the shear rate in the strand. For example, during shear-induced demixing, only the exterior of the strand, i.e., the high shear rate region, became opaque. Above the LCST, shear-induced mixing occurred, and only the center region of the strand became opaque.

A total of 156 pregnant white Polish women aged between 20 and 43 years and screened to detect high risk for  MESHD002869  in the first trimester were included in the study.  MESHD001281  samples were collected from these women during routine diagnostic and treatment procedures at mid-gestation (15-22 weeks of their pregnancies). The concentrations of various minerals in the  MESHD001281  were determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Genomic hybridization and cytogenetic karyotyping were performed to detect chromosomal aberrations in the fetuses. The genetic analysis revealed chromosomal aberrations in 19 fetuses (over 12% of all the evaluated women). The major abnormalities identified were trisomy 21 (N = 11), trisomy 18 (N = 2), and  MESHD057885  (N = 2). Fetuses with  MESHD002869  more frequently showed lower  MESHD008345  concentration in the  MESHD001281  in the second trimester as compared to those with normal karyotype. A coincidence was observed between high  MESHD007501  levels in the  MESHD001281  and a higher risk of  MESHD002869  in the fetuses. 
35455298	 MESHD000068879  in Treating Refractory Livedoid  MESHD020144  Livedoid  MESHD020144  is a chronic, recurrent  MESHD012871 . It seriously affects the quality of patients' life. However, the pathogenesis has not been fully identified yet. Here, this retrospective study describes the successful use of anti- NCBIGene7124  NCBIGene7124  agent  MESHD000068879  in three cases of refractory livedoid  MESHD020144 , which has not been reported previously. In addition, we provide some clinical evidence that  MESHD000068879  therapy is efficient in improving  MESHD012871  and relieving the  MESHD010146  of livedoid  MESHD020144 . 
35439272	Global structural stability and the role of cooperation in mutualistic systems Dynamical systems on graphs allow to describe multiple phenomena from different areas of Science. In particular, many complex systems in Ecology are studied by this approach. In this paper we analize the mathematical framework for the study of the structural stability of each stationary point, feasible or not, introducing a generalization for this concept, defined as Global Structural Stability. This approach would fit with the proper mathematical concept of structural stability, in which we find a full description of the complex dynamics on the phase space due to nonlinear dynamics. This fact can be analyzed as an informational field grounded in a global attractor whose structure can be completely characterized. These attractors are stable under perturbation and suppose the minimal structurally stable sets. We also study in detail, mathematically and computationally, the zones characterizing different levels of biodiversity in bipartite graphs describing mutualistic antagonistic systems of population dynamics. In particular, we investigate the dependence of the region of maximal biodiversity of a system on its connectivity matrix. On the other hand, as the network topology does not completely determine the robustness of the dynamics of a complex network, we study the correlation between structural stability and several graph measures. A systematic study on synthetic and biological graphs is presented, including 10 mutualistic networks of plants and seed-dispersal and 1000 random synthetic networks. We compare the role of centrality measures and modularity, concluding the importance of just cooperation strength among nodes when describing areas of maximal biodiversity. Indeed, we show that cooperation parameters are the central role for biodiversity while other measures act as secondary supporting functions.

35450125	Perinatal  MESHD002389  in a Patient with a Twin Pregnancy of Unknown Chorionicity and Gestational Age Presenting in Spontaneous  MESHD007752   MESHD002389  during pregnancy is rare and presents unique challenges due to the potential ramifications to mom and baby of the overall disease state and of potential treatment options. The purpose of this case report is to highlight the complexities in the workup and management of a catatonic patient with concurrent acute obstetric concerns requiring urgent intervention. We report a case of  MESHD002389  due to underlying major  MESHD000275  in a patient who presented in spontaneous  MESHD007752 , with a twin pregnancy of unknown chorionicity with no known prenatal care. She underwent an extensive workup with no significant findings on lumbar puncture, brain MRI, metabolic labs, and EEG. After exclusion of several acute underlying conditions, a presumptive diagnosis of  MESHD002389  secondary to exacerbation of underlying major  MESHD000275  was made. She was transferred to an inpatient  MESHD001523  facility postdelivery and treated with a course of  MESHD008140 ,  MESHD000068180 , and  MESHD015283  with good effect. 
35521541	Flexible engineering of advanced phase change materials Summary Liquid phase leakage, intrinsic  MESHD009127 , and  MESHD010013  are the longstanding bottlenecks of phase change materials (PCMs) for thermal energy storage, which seriously hinder their widespread applications in advanced energy-efficient systems. Emerging flexible composite PCMs that are capable of enduring certain deformation and guaranteeing superior mutual contact with integrated devices are considered as a cutting-edge effective solution. Flexible PCMs-based thermal regulation technology can reallocate thermal energy and regulate the temperature within an optimal range. Currently, tireless efforts are devoted to the development of versatile flexible PCMs-based thermal regulation devices, and a big step forward has been taken. Herein, we systematically outline fabrication techniques, flexibility evaluation strategies, advanced functions and advances of flexible composite PCMs. Furthermore, existing challenges and future perspectives are provided in terms of flexible PCMs-based thermal regulation techniques. This insightful review aims to provide an in-depth understanding and constructive guidance of engineering advanced flexible multifunctional PCMs. Graphical abstract Inorganic materials; Materials science; Materials chemistry; Materials synthesis 
35325394	Analysis of common methodological flaws in the highest cited e-cigarette epidemiology research The prevalence of vaping, also known as using e-cigarettes, vapes and vape pens, has prompted a demand for reliable, evidence-based research. However, published literature on the topic of vaping often raises concerns, characterized by serious flaws and a failure to adhere to accepted scientific methodologies. In this narrative review, we analyze popular vaping studies published in medical journals that purport to evaluate the association of vaping and smoking cessation, smoking initiation or health outcomes. We analyzed 24 included studies to identify the questions they claimed to address, stated methods, manner of implementation, discussions, and stated conclusions. After critical appraisal, we noted a multiplicity of flaws in these studies, and identified patterns as to the nature of such flaws. Many studies lacked a clear hypothesis statement: to the extent that a hypothesis could be inferred, the methods were not tailored to address the question of interest. Moreover, main outcome measures were poorly identified, and data analysis was further complicated by failure to control for confounding factors. The body of literature on "gateway" theory for the initiation of smoking was particularly unreliable. Overall, the results and discussion contained numerous unreliable assertions due to poor methods, including data collection that lacked relevance, and assertions that were unfounded. Many researchers claimed to find a causal association while not supporting such findings with meaningful data: the discussions and conclusions of such studies were, therefore, misleading. Herein, we identify the common flaws in the study design, methodology, and implementation found in published vaping studies. We present our summary recommendations for future vaping research. Our aim is to prompt future researchers to adhere to scientific methods to produce more reliable findings and conclusions in the field of vaping research. 
34089125	Well-Differentiated  MESHD018208 -like Morphology with  NCBIGene4193  NCBIGene4193  and  NCBIGene1649  NCBIGene1649  Co-Amplification Well-differentiated  MESHD008080  (WDL) is one of the most common soft tissue  MESHD012509  in adults. It has a predilection for middle-aged males and arises in deep-seated locations such as retroperitoneum, mediastinum, and spermatic cord. Its occurrence in young individuals at the hypopharyngeal region is an exceedingly rare event.  MESHD018208  (ML)-like changes can seldom occur in some cases of WDL, which makes the diagnosis of WDL more challenging. Amplification of  NCBIGene1649  NCBIGene1649  gene in a subset of cases of WDL has shown to be associated with such unique morphology. Herein, we present a case of a 36-year-old gentleman who presented with difficulty in breathing and swallowing for 3 months duration. CT scan of the neck revealed a lesion along the posterior wall of the hypopharynx measuring 3.5 cm. Histopathologic examination revealed a  MESHD009369  composed of lobules of oval to spindle cells in a prominent myxoid stroma with delicate  NCBITaxon9031  NCBITaxon9031 -wire vasculature. In the vicinity, there were lobules composed of variably sized adipocytes separated by thick fibrous septa that contains atypical hyperchromatic spindle cells. By immunohistochemistry, the  MESHD009369  cells in both components were immunoreactive for  NCBIGene1019  NCBIGene1019 , but negative for  NCBIGene4193  NCBIGene4193 . Fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) confirmed the presence of  NCBIGene4193  NCBIGene4193  gene amplification. There was no evidence of  NCBIGene2521  NCBIGene2521 - NCBIGene1649  NCBIGene1649  gene rearrangement, however,  NCBIGene1649  NCBIGene1649  gene was also amplified. The diagnosis of well-differentiated  MESHD008080  with prominent myxoid stroma was rendered. This is the first documentation of WDL with ML-like morphology harboring co-amplification of  NCBIGene4193  NCBIGene4193  and  NCBIGene1649  NCBIGene1649  in the hypopharynx. 
35497834	Construction of octenyl succinic anhydride modified porous  MESHD013213  for improving bioaccessibility of  MESHD019207  in emulsions  Modified porous  MESHD013213  (PS), by introducing octenyl succinic anhydride (OSA) moieties, was synthesized successfully, which was applied as an emulsion of  MESHD019207  for the first time. The pores and channels within porous  MESHD013213  provided more possibilities for OSA to modify  MESHD013213 . The  MESHD004952  linkage of OSA modified PS with different degrees of substitution (DS) were confirmed by both  MESHC000615229  solid-state NMR and Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). The hydrophobic octenyl succinic and hydrophilic hydroxyl groups of OSA modified PS showed the good emulsifying capability, which could be utilized to prepare  MESHD019207  emulsions. And the bioaccessibility of  MESHD019207  was also enhanced with increasing DS of OSA modified starch. This study not only paves a new way using porous  MESHD013213  for modification of  MESHD013213 , but also offers an attractive alternative for obtaining emulsion-based delivery systems for bioactive components. The synthesis and application of OSA modified porous  MESHD013213 . 
35496521	Interface metallization enabled an ultra-stable Fe2O3 hierarchical anode for pseudocapacitors  Despite significant advances in cathode materials, developing high-performance anodes remains a key challenge for future pseudocapacitors. Fe2O3 has been considered as a promising anode candidate due to its high theoretical capacitance, environmental benignity, and earth-abundant characteristics. However, the low electronic conductivity and poor cyclability of Fe2O3 significantly limit its practical application. In this work, a 3D ni MESHD009532 etalized ca MESHD002244 anofiber network was developed to deposit an Fe2O3 nanosheet anode. The ni MESHD009532 ayer not only improved the electronic conductivity and the wettability of the 3D ca MESHD002244 ubstrate but also benefit the stability of the Fe2O3/ca MESHD002244 nterfaces and the stress-release upon cycling. As a result, the newly designed Fe2O3 anode composite exhibited a high areal capacitance of 1.80 F cm-2 at a high mass loading of 4.2 mg cm-1 and ultra-high capacitance retention of 85.1% after successive 100 000 cycles, outperformed most of the reported Fe2O3-based anode materials. Extended the interface metallization method to a MnO2 cathode, excellent capacitance retention of 108.2% was reached after 26 000 cycles, suggesting a potentially broad application of such an interface-management method in elevating the stability of metal oxide materials in various pseudocapacitive energy storage devices. An ultra-stable Fe2O3 anode composite was developed by nickel met MESHD009532 ng the interfaces between the Fe2O3 nanosheets and the carbon nan MESHD002244  substrate. High capacitance retention of 85.1% after 100 000 cycles was reached under a high mass loading of 4.2 mg cm-1. 
35498598	Advanced treatment of coal chemical reverse osmosis concentrate with three-stage MABR The issue of reverse osmosis concentrate (ROC) has attracted significant attention due to its complex and toxic constituents under high salinity conditions. In this work, a three-stage membrane-aerated biofilm reactor (MABR) system was constructed to treat such wastewater without an external  MESHD002244  source. The effects of operating conditions including aeration pressure, reflux ratio, temperature and  MESHD016055  time on the removal performance of the integrated system were evaluated and optimized. Under the optimal operating parameters, the removal efficiencies of COD, NH4+-N, NO3--N, and TN reached 69.36%, 80.95%, 54.55%, and 54.36%, respectively. Three-dimensional fluorescence analysis indicated that  MESHD006812  was mostly removed from raw  MESHD014867 . Moreover, microbial diversity analysis indicated that the microbial community structure of each reactor could be individually modulated to exert different functions and enhance the system performance. The integrated MABR system exhibits great feasibility and potential for the advanced treatment of coal chemical ROC. A MABR system was constructed to treat coal chemical reverse osmosis concentrate without an external carbon MESHD002244 e. 
35498564	Evaluation of a multiple and global analytical indicator of batch consistency: traditional Chinese medicine injection as a case study  This paper evaluates a multiple and global analytical indicator of batch consistency in traditional Chinese medicine injections (TCMIs) via a chemometrics tool, which is more comprehensive to appraise quality consistency of different batches of injections than the traditional method of fingerprint similarity. A commonly used TCMI, Salviae miltiorrhizae and ligustrazine hydrochloride injection (SLI), was employed as a model. With the aid of a chemometrics tool (principal component analysis, PCA), evaluation of multiple and global analytical indicators of batch consistency, which included sa MESHD002241 ph MESHC017616 nd inorganic salts (18 indicators in total), was carried out to appraise the quality consistency of 13 batches of injection provided by the Guizhou Baite Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (Guizhou, China). Compared with the traditional HPLC-UV fingerprint similarity evaluation, the method proposed in the paper can more comprehensively and correctly reflect the quality consistency of different batches of injections. In this paper, the multi-index evaluation result showed poor batch consistency, which was more consistent with the determination results, while the fingerprint similarity evaluation results still showed good batch consistency. The HPLC-UV fingerprint reflects only substances with UV absorption, but it is not able to reflect substances without UV absorption or weak UV absorption, which leads to inappropriate conclusions. Therefore, quality consistency of injections can be effectively appraised by evaluation of multiple and global analytical indicators, instead of HPLC-UV fingerprint only. For visualizing the batch consistency of the multiple and global analytical indicators, a heat map was used to represent the fluctuation. Furthermore, critical indicator identification was also applied to select several indicators that should be paid more attention during the process of quality control of injection. And the analysis result showed that Na+, fr MESHD005632 Fr MESHD005632  gl MESHD005947 Gl MESHD005947  ma MESHC069155 Ma MESHC069155  da MESHC035055 DS MESHC035055 and sa MESHC076944 SA MESHC076944 are the indicators that should be given more attention when controlling the quality of injections, also called critical quality control indicators. The proposed method provides a reference for the quality control of TCMIs and has broad application potential. Evaluation of a multiple and global analytical indicator of batch consistency was employed in TCMIs with a multivariate statistical tool. 
35463128	Localization of the Center of the Intramuscular Nerve Dense Region of the Suboccipital Muscles: An Anatomical Study Purpose This study aimed to determine the body surface puncture position and depth of the center of the intramuscular nerve dense region in the suboccipital muscle to provide morphological guidance for accurate botulinum toxin A injection to treat  MESHD006261  caused by increased suboccipital muscle tension. Methods Twenty-four cadavers aged 66.5 +- 5.3 years were studied. The curve line connecting occipital eminence or mastoid process and spinous process of the 7th cervical vertebrae was considered the longitudinal reference line (L) and horizontal reference line (H), respectively. Sihler's staining,  MESHD001466  labeling, and CT were employed. The body surface projection point of the center of the intramuscular nerve dense region was designated as P. The projection of the center of the intramuscular nerve dense region was in the opposite direction across the transverse plane and was recorded as P'. The intersections of the vertical line through point P and lines L and H were designated as PL and  NCBIGene4172  NCBIGene4172 . The percentage position of the  NCBIGene4172  NCBIGene4172  and PL points on the H and L lines and the depths of the center of intramuscular nerve dense regions were identified. Results Sihler's staining showed one intramuscular nerve-dense region in each suboccipital muscle. The  NCBIGene4172  NCBIGene4172  of the center of the intramuscular nerve dense region was located at 51.40, 45.55, 20.55, and 43.50%. The PL was located at 31.38, 30.08, 16.91, and 52.94%. The depth of the center of the intramuscular nerve dense region was at 22.26, 22.54, 13.14, and 27.30%. These percentage values are all the means. Conclusion Accurately defining the body surface position and depth of the center of intramuscular nerve dense region in suboccipital muscles will help to improve botulinum toxin A to target localization efficiency for treating  MESHD018781 . 
35520928	Room-temperature synthesized SnO2 electron transport layers for efficient perovskite solar cells  Ti MESHC045358 SnO2) is widely used as electron transport layer (ETL) material in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Numerous synthesis methods for SnO2 have been reported, but they all require a proper thermal treatment for the SnO2 ETLs. Herein we present a simple method to synthesize SnO2 nanoparticles (NPs) at room temperature. By using bu MESHC006848 s a precipitator and a proper UV-Ozone treatment to remove Cl residuals, excellent SnO2 ETLs were obtained without any thermal annealing. The highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the prepared PSCs was 19.22% for reverse scan (RS) and 18.79% for forward scan (FS). Furthermore, flexible PSCs were fabricated with high PCEs of 15.27%/14.74% (RS/FS). The low energy consuming SnO2 ETLs therefore show great promise for the flexible PSCs' commercialization. Room-temperature processed SnO2 as electron transport layer materials for efficient flexible perovskite solar cells. 
35464879	The association between  MESHD003920  and incidence of  MESHD000275  episodes is different based on sex: insights from ELSA-Brasil Objective: To investigate the association between  MESHD003920  ( MESHD009223 ) and incidence of  MESHD000275  episodes among men and women. Methods: Data were used from 12,730 participants (5866 men and 6864 women) at baseline (2008-2010) and follow-up 1 (2012-2014) of the Longitudinal Study of Adult Health (ELSA-Brasil), a multicenter cohort of Brazilian civil servants. Participants were classified for  MESHD003920  using self-reported and clinical information, and evaluated for presence of  MESHD000275  episodes by the Clinical Interview Schedule-Revised (CIS-R). Associations were estimated by means of logistic regression models (crude and adjusted for socio-demographic variables). Results: Women classified as with DM pri MESHD009223  to the baseline were at 48% greater risk (95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.03-2.07) of depres MESHD000275 des in the crude model and 54% greater risk (95% CI = 1.06-2.19) in the final adjusted model compared to women classified as non-DM.

35515312	Efficient catalytic conversion of corn stalk and  MESHD014994  into  MESHD005662  over sulfonated  MESHD006108  in  MESHC037556   Sulfonated graphene (SG) was prepared and employed to convert corn stalk and  MESHD014994  into  MESHD005662 . Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) were used to characterize SG. The effects of reaction time, temperature, substrate loading, catalyst dosage and solvents on the reaction were researched and optimized. SG exhibited high catalytic activity in the conversion of  MESHD014994  and corn stalk to  MESHD005662 . A fairly high furfural yield of 96% was achieved at 150  C from xylose and a 71.9% furfural yield was obtained when using a 10.7 ratio (mass ratio: xylose to SG) at 140  C. While a 48% furfural yield was obtained from corn stalk (based on the starting combined moles of xylan and glucan in corn stalk; yield was >100%, if based on only xylan) using a substrate loading (corn stalk to catalyst mass ratio) of 2.14 and a 19% 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF) yield was obtained. What's more, a 43.9% yield of  MESHD005662  was obtained in only 20 min. In addition, the reusability of SG was also investigated and shown to have good stability for  MESHD003681 .

35493436	CD47 antibody protects  NCBITaxon10090  NCBITaxon10090  from  MESHD004317 -induced  MESHD009202  by suppressing cardiomyocyte apoptosis Cluster of differentiation 47 (CD47) is upregulated in  NCBITaxon10090  NCBITaxon10090  models of  MESHD004317  ( MESHD004317 )-induced  MESHD002311  (DCM). To explore the role of CD47 in the development of DCM, in the present study, CD47 signaling was blocked by an anti-CD47 neutralizing antibody (aCD47) in  NCBITaxon10090  NCBITaxon10090  with  MESHD004317 -induced DCM. Intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of 10 mg/kg  MESHD004317  once a week significantly induced the development of DCM after 4 weeks, which was accompanied by the upregulation of CD47 expression in heart tissues. However, co-administration of  MESHD004317  with 7 mg/kg aCD47 once a week significantly reduced the severity of DCM, with lower numbers of disordered and broken myofibers, reduced cardiomyocytes and infiltration of macrophages in the heart tissues of treated  NCBITaxon10090  NCBITaxon10090 . The beneficial effects were associated with the reduced population of  NCBIGene11747  NCBIGene11747 +7-AAD- apoptotic cells, and the attenuated formation of interstitial  MESHD005355  and release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in the aCD47-treated  NCBITaxon10090  NCBITaxon10090 . In addition, co-administration with aCD47 effectively reduced the expression of  NCBIGene12028  NCBIGene12028 , collagen I,  NCBIGene16193  NCBIGene16193  and  NCBIGene21926  NCBIGene21926  in  NCBITaxon10090  NCBITaxon10090  DCM. These results were further supported by an in vitro study, in which aCD47 pre-treatment significantly reduced the  MESHD004317 -induced early apoptosis of cardiomyocytes and suppressed the expression of  NCBIGene12028  NCBIGene12028 , cleaved  NCBIGene12362  NCBIGene12367  NCBIGene12362  NCBIGene12367  and phosphorylation of  NCBIGene26416  NCBIGene26416 . Therefore, aCD47 attenuated DCM in  NCBITaxon10090  NCBITaxon10090 , possibly by suppressing cardiomyocyte early apoptosis and  NCBIGene26416  NCBIGene26416  signaling. CD47 may be a useful therapeutic target in the treatment of DCM. 
35440044	A prospective investigation into the association between the  NCBITaxon749906  NCBITaxon749906  composition and cognitive performance among healthy young adults Background There is emerging evidence that the  NCBITaxon749906  NCBITaxon749906  composition is associated with several human health outcomes, which include cognitive performance. However, only a few prospective epidemiological studies exist and none among young adults. Here we address the gap in the literature by investigating whether the  NCBITaxon749906  NCBITaxon749906  composition is prospectively linked to fluid intelligence among healthy young adults. Methods Forty individuals (65% females, 26 years) from the DOrtmund Nutritional and Anthropometric Longitudinally Designed (DONALD) study provided a fecal sample for  NCBITaxon749906  NCBITaxon749906  composition and subsequently (average of 166 days) completed a cognitive functioning test using the Cattell's Culture Fair Intelligence Test, revised German version (CFT 20-R). The assessment of the  NCBITaxon749906  NCBITaxon749906  at the genera level was by 16S rRNA V3-V4 Illumina sequencing. The relative abundance of 158 genera was summarized into bacterial communities using a novel data-driven dimension reduction, amalgamation. The fluid intelligence score was regressed on the relative abundance of the bacterial communities and adjusted for selected covariates. Results The 158 genera were amalgamated into 12 amalgams (bacterial communities), which were composed of 18, 6, 10, 14, 8, 10, 16, 13, 12, 12, 3, and 11 genera. Only the 14-genera bacterial community, named the "Ruminococcaceae- and Coriobacteriaceae-dominant community" was positively associated with fluid intelligence score (beta = 7.8; 95% CI: 0.62, 15.65, P = 0.04). Conclusion Among healthy young adults, the abundance of a gut bacterial community was associated with fluid intelligence score. This study suggests that cognitive performance may potentially benefit from gut microbiome NCBITaxon749906  NCBITaxon749906 ntion. 
35453192	Evaluate the Effectiveness of Outpatient Parenteral Antimicrobial Therapy (OPAT) Program in Saudi Arabia: A Retrospective Study (1) Background: Outpatient parenteral antibiotic therapy (OPAT) is a well-established and cost-effective measure that improves the efficient use of healthcare resources and increases bed availability. Only limited published data is available to illustrate OPAT implementation and outcomes in Saudi Arabia. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of OPAT in a tertiary center in Saudi Arabia. (2) Methods: In this retrospective study, clinical charts of enrolled patients were reviewed in a tertiary care center from the initial month of November 2017 to March 2020. All admitted patients with a central line and who enrolled in the OPAT of the hospital during this study period were included. The primary outcome was the 30-days readmission rate of OPAT patients. Secondary outcomes were factors associated with OPAT failure. Descriptive analysis of the data was used to express the results. (3) Results: We enrolled 90 patients; 54 (60%) were male; the mean age was 55.16 (+-17.7) years old. The mean duration of the antimicrobial treatment was 21.9 (+24.6) days. All patients completed the intended course of therapy.  MESHD000077727  was the most frequently used antimicrobial (43%), followed by  MESHD014640  (11.2%). Urinary tract  MESHD007239  (UTIs) are some of the most common  MESHD001424  in 25 patients (26.9%), followed by  MESHD010019  in 16 patients (17.2%). Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase  NCBITaxon562  NCBITaxon562  was the highest common isolated microorganism (44.9%), followed by methicillin-resistant  NCBITaxon1280  NCBITaxon1280  MRSA (16.9%). The readmission to the hospital during therapy was required for 12 patients (13.3%). Shifting from hospital care to OPAT care resulted in cost savings of 18 million  NCBITaxon2698737  NCBITaxon2698737  in the overall assessment period and avoided a total of 1984 patient days of hospitalization. (4) Conclusion: The findings have shown that OPAT therapy was effective with minimum hospital readmissions and therapy complications. OPAT programs can reduce healthcare costs and should be integrated into practice. 
35519389	Molecular dynamics simulations of a  MESHC007950 / MESHC029424  5,5'-bitetrazole-1,1'-diolate cocrystal  An energetic ionic salt (EIS)-based cocrystal formation, cyclot MESHC007950 /h MESHC007950 azine 5,5'-bitetrazole-1,1'-diolate (HA BTO), is predicted based on molecular dynamics simulations. HA BTO is a newly-synthesized environmentally friendly energetic ionic salt w MESHD012492 good detonation performance and low sensitivity. Calculated powder X-ray diffraction patterns and intermolecular interactions deduce the formation of the new cocrystal structure. Radial distribution function analysis suggests that hydrog MESHD006859  and van der Waals (vdW) forces exist between the H O pairs of HMX and HA BTO, while the hydrog MESHD006859  between the H of HA BTO and the O of HMX play a prominent role. The cohesive energy density and mechanical properties are also analyzed. The cohesive energy density of the HMX/HA BTO cocrystal is larger than that of the composite of HMX and HA BTO, indicating an improvement in crystal stability by cocrystalization. Compared to both HMX and HA BTO, HMX/HA BTO has smaller Young modulus, bulk modulus and shear modulus values, but larger K/G values and a positive Cauchy pressure, suggesting decrea MESHD002303 mproved ductibility. Moreover, the calculated formation energy is -405.79 kJ mol-1 at 298 K, which implies that the proposed cocrystal structure is likely to be synthesized at ambient temperature. In summary, we have predicted an EIS-based cocrystal formation in which the safety and mechanical properties of HMX have been improved via cocrystalization with HA BTO, and this provides deep insight into the formation mechanism of the EIS-based cocrystal. An energetic ionic salt-based cocrystal form MESHD012492 n, HMX/HA BTO, is predicted based on molecular dynamics simulations.

35514699	A highly sensitive gas sensor employing biomorphic SnO2 with multi-level tubes/pores structure: bio-templated from waste of flax Metal oxide gas sensors with porous structures are widely used in numerous applications ranging from health monitoring and medical detection to safety; in this study, we report a highly sensitive SnO2 gas sensor with a multi-level tube/pore structure prepared via biomimetic technology using  NCBITaxon4006  NCBITaxon4006  waste as a bio-template and a simple wet chemical process combined with subsequent annealing. Indeed, MLTPS not only maintained and improved the excellence of porous structure gas sensing materials with abundant active sites and large surface-to-volume ratios, but also overcame the deficiency of the lack of gas diffusion channels in porous gas sensing materials. Thus, this novel multi-level tube/pore SnO2 gas sensor exhibited significantly enhanced sensing performance, e.g. an ultra-low response concentration (250 ppb), a high response (87.9), a fast response (9.2 s), a low operating temperature (130  C) and good stability, for  MESHD005557 . On the basis of these results, via the reuse of agricultural waste, this study provides a new concept for the low-cost synthesis of environmentally friendly and effective multi-level tube/pore gas sensor materials. Metal oxides gas sensors are widely used in numerous applications from health, medical detection to safety. By bio-templating from waste of f NCBITaxon4006  NCBITaxon4006  this paper reports a highly sensitive SnO2 gas sensor with multi-level tubes/pores structure. 
35457963	The Effects of the Food Additive  MESHC009495  ( MESHC009495 ) on Tumor Formation and Gene Expression in the Colon of a  NCBITaxon10090  NCBITaxon10090   NCBITaxon10090  NCBITaxon10090  Model for  MESHD015179   MESHC009495  (TiO2) is present in many different food products as the food additive E171, which is currently scrutinized due to its potential adverse effects, including the stimulation of  MESHD009369  formation in the gastrointestinal tract. We developed a  NCBITaxon10090  NCBITaxon10090   NCBITaxon10090  NCBITaxon10090  model to examine the effects of E171 on  MESHD015179  (CRC), using the Cre-LoxP system to create an  NCBIGene11789  NCBIGene11789 -gene-knockout model which spontaneously develops  MESHD015179 . A pilot study showed that E171 exposed  NCBITaxon10090  NCBITaxon10090  developed  MESHD015179 , which were accompanied by enhanced  MESHD006965  in epithelial cells, lymphatic nodules at the base of the  MESHD011127 , and increased  MESHD009369  size. In the main study,  MESHD009369  formation was studied following the exposure to 5 mg/kgbw/day of E171 for 9 weeks (Phase I).  MESHC009495  exposure showed a statistically nonsignificant increase in the number of  MESHD015179  in these  NCBITaxon10090  NCBITaxon10090 , as well as a statistically nonsignificant increase in the average number of  NCBITaxon10090  NCBITaxon10090  with  MESHD009369 . Gene expression changes in the colon were analyzed after exposure to 1, 2, and 5 mg/kgbw/day of  MESHC009495  for 2, 7, 14, and 21 days (Phase II). Whole-genome mRNA analysis revealed the modulation of genes in pathways involved in the regulation of gene expression, cell cycle, post-translational modification, nuclear receptor signaling, and circadian rhythm. The processes associated with these genes might be involved in the enhanced  MESHD009369  formation and suggest that E171 may contribute to  MESHD009369  formation and progression by modulation of events related to  MESHD007249 , activation of immune responses, cell cycle, and  MESHD009369  signaling.

The primary outcome measure was the critical action item sum score. We sought validity evidence to support our findings by including attending neurocritical care physicians and comparing performance across four levels of training. Results Forty-nine participants completed the simulation. The mean sum of critical actions completed by trainees was 10/21 (49%). Eleven (22%) trainees verbalized a differential diagnosis for the arrest MESHD006323 ty-two (65%) reviewed the electrocardiogram, recognized it as abnormal, and consulted cardiology. Forty trainees (81%) independently decided to start temperature management, but only 20 (41%) insisted on it when asked to reconsider. There was an effect of level of training on critical action checklist sum scores (novice mean score [standard deviation (SD)] = 4.8(1.8) vs. intermediate mean score (SD) = 10.4(2.1) vs. advanced mean score (D) = 11.6(3.0) vs. expert mean score (SD) = 14.7(2.2)) Conclusions High-fidelity manikin-based simulation holds promise as an assessment tool in the performance of post-cardiac arrest MESHD006323 
35455649	Epigenetics in Precision Nutrition Precision nutrition is an emerging area of nutrition research, with primary focus on the individual variability in response to dietary and lifestyle factors, which are mainly determined by an individual's intrinsic variations, such as those in genome, epigenome, and  NCBITaxon749906  NCBITaxon749906 . The current research on precision nutrition is heavily focused on genome and  NCBITaxon749906  NCBITaxon749906 , while epigenome (DNA methylation, non-coding RNAs, and histone modification) is largely neglected. The epigenome acts as the interface between the human genome and environmental stressors, including diets and lifestyle. Increasing evidence has suggested that epigenetic modifications, particularly DNA methylation, may determine the individual variability in metabolic health and response to dietary and lifestyle factors and, therefore, hold great promise in discovering novel markers for precision nutrition and potential targets for precision interventions. This review summarized recent studies on DNA methylation with  MESHD009765 ,  MESHD003920 , and  MESHD002318 , with more emphasis put in the relations of DNA methylation with nutrition and diet/lifestyle interventions. We also briefly reviewed other epigenetic events, such as non-coding RNAs, in relation to human health and nutrition, and discussed the potential role of epigenetics in the precision nutrition research.  
35504139	Effect of the area of a  MESHC091692  transducer on the efficiency of ultrasonic atomization driven by resonance vibration Highlights Each LN-based device produced peak  MESHD014867  particle sizes in the range 3.2-4.2 microm. Larger transducer area increased atomization volume but decreased efficiency. The optimal LN size for efficient atomization area was found to be 8 mm x 10 mm. FEM results and impedance analysis suggested that mode mixing reduced atomization. In recent years, individual control of one's personal environment has been drawing increasing attention due to the growing interest in health care. Wearable devices are especially useful because of their controllability regardless of location. Humidity is one of the inevitable factors in the personal environment as a preventive against infec MESHD003141 hough atomization devices are commonly used as a method of humidity control, at present, there are no wearable humidity control devices. Vibration of a lithi MESHC091692  device in the thickness mode is a promising piezoelectric method for miniaturization of atomization devices for humidity control. To miniaturize the atomization device, the transducer size needs to be small not so much as to decrease the atomization efficiency. However, the effect of the device area on the atomization efficiency of LN at a size suitable for mounting in wearable devices has not been studied. Here, we conducted an atomization demonstration of LN devices with different sizes to evaluate particle size and atomization efficiency. Furthermore, to reveal the relationship between vibration behavior and atomization efficiency, resonance vibration in the MHz frequency band was evaluated by the finite element method and an impedance analyzer. The results showed that the peak size of water MESHD014867 icles atomized by each device was in the range of 3.2 to 4.2 microm, which is smaller than particles produced by typical piezoelectric ceramics. Moreover, the best LN size for efficient atomization was found to be 8 mm x 10 mm among the five LN device sizes used in experiments. From the relationship between vibration behavior and atomization efficiency, the size of the transducer was suggested to affect the vibration mode. The obtained result suggested that the LN device is suitable for small wearable nebulizer devices. 
35448474	Characterization of Constituents with Potential Anti-Inflammatory Activity in Chinese  NCBITaxon638626  NCBITaxon638626  Species by UHPLC-HRMS Based Metabolite Profiling This study centered on detecting potentially anti-inflammatory active constituents in ethanolic extracts of Chinese  NCBITaxon638626  NCBITaxon638626  species by taking an UHPLC-HRMS-based metabolite profiling approach. Extracts from eight different  NCBITaxon638626  NCBITaxon638626  species were subjected to both UHPLC-HRMS analysis and to pharmacological testing in three different cellular  MESHD007249 -related assays. Compounds exhibiting high correlations in orthogonal projections to latent structures discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) of pharmacological and MS data served as potentially activity-related candidates. Of these candidates, 65 were tentatively or unambiguously annotated. 7-Hydroxy-5,3',4',5'-tetramethoxyflavone and three  MESHD005419 , as well as three C32- and one C34-acetylated polyhydroxy fatty acid, were isolated from  NCBITaxon638626  NCBITaxon638626  leaves for the first time, and their structures were fully or partially elucidated. Of the potentially active candidate compounds, 15 were subsequently subjected to pharmacological testing. Their activities could be experimentally verified in part, emphasizing the relevance of  NCBITaxon638626  NCBITaxon638626  species as a source of anti-inflammatory active constituents. However, some compounds also impaired the cell viability. Overall, the approach was found useful to narrow down the number of potentially bioactive constituents in the complex extracts investigated. In the future, the application of more refined concepts, such as extract prefractionation combined with bio-chemometrics, may help to further enhance the reliability of candidate selection. 
35454494	3D-Printed Double-Helical Biodegradable  MESHD007501  Suture Anchor: A Rabbit Rotator Cuff Tear Model Suture anchors are extensively used in rotator cuff tear surgery. With the advancement of three-dimensional printing technology, biodegradable  MESHD008670  has been developed for orthopedic applications. This study adopted three-dimensional-printed biodegradable  MESHD007501  suture anchors with double-helical threads and commercialized non-vented screw-type  MESHD014025  suture anchors with a tapered tip in the experimental and control groups, respectively. The in vitro study showed that the  MESHD007501  and  MESHD014025  suture anchors exhibited a similar ultimate failure load in 20-pound-per-cubic-foot  MESHD011140  foam blocks and rabbit bone. In static immersion tests, the corrosion rate of  MESHD007501  suture anchors was 0.049 +- 0.002 mm/year. The in vivo study was performed on New Zealand white  NCBITaxon9986  NCBITaxon9986  and SAs were employed to reattach the  MESHD052256 . The in vivo ultimate failure load of the  MESHD007501  suture anchors was superior to that of the  MESHD014025  suture anchors at 6 weeks. Micro-computed tomography showed that the bone volume fraction and bone surface density in the  MESHD007501  suture anchors group 2 and 6 weeks after surgery were superior, and the histology confirmed that the increased bone volume around the anchor was attributable to mineralized osteocytes. The three-dimensional-printed  MESHD007501  suture anchors outperformed the currently used  MESHD014025  suture anchors. 
35455173	Intrinsic Dimension Estimation-Based Feature Selection and Multinomial Logistic Regression for Classification of Bearing Faults Using Compressively Sampled Vibration Signals As failures of rolling bearings lead to major failures in rotating machines, recent vibration-based rolling bearing fault diagnosis techniques are focused on obtaining useful fault features from the huge collection of raw data. However, too many features reduce the classification accuracy and increase the computation time. This paper proposes an effective feature selection technique based on intrinsic dimension estimation of compressively sampled vibration signals. First, compressive sampling ( NCBIGene1431  NCBIGene1431 ) is used to get compressed measurements from the collected raw vibration signals. Then, a global dimension estimator, the geodesic minimal spanning tree (GMST), is employed to compute the minimal number of features needed to represent efficiently the compressively sampled signals. Finally, a feature selection process, combining the stochastic proximity embedding (SPE) and the neighbourhood component analysis (NCA), is used to select fewer features for bearing fault diagnosis. With regression analysis-based predictive modelling technique and the multinomial logistic regression (MLR) classifier, the selected features are assessed in two case studies of rolling bearings vibration signals under different working loads. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can successfully select fewer features, with which the MLR-based trained model achieves high classification accuracy and significantly reduced computation times compared to published research. 
35089544	A survey of labour epidural practices at obstetric anesthesia fellowship programs in the United States Purpose Labour epidural analgesia (LEA) is an evolving field. Various neuraxial techniques and dosing regimens are available to the modern obstetric anesthesia provider, allowing for significant practice variability. To begin a search for consensus on optimal care, we sought to query fellowship training practices for LEA. Methods We conducted an electronic survey of institutions with American Council for Graduate Medical Education-accredited obstetric anesthesiology fellowship programs. We studied the frequency of epidural initiation techniques, including combined spinal epidural ( NCBIGene1433  NCBIGene1433 ), dural puncture epidural, and epidural bolus. For maintenance techniques, we appraised the use of continuous epidural infusion, programmed intermittent bolus (PIEB), and patient-controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA). Results Of 40 institutions surveyed, we received 32 responses (80% response rate). Twenty-eight of 40 (70%) were included in the analysis. A plurality of institutions (12/28; 43%) preferred  NCBIGene1433  NCBIGene1433 , and among those who used  NCBIGene1433  NCBIGene1433 , 23/27 (85%) included intrathecal opioids. A majority of institutions used protocols with PIEB (55%), while almost all (92%) used PCEA. Most participants (88%) reported using dilute concentration maintenance infusions of 0.1%  MESHD002045 / MESHD000077212  or less. Conclusion Despite significant variability in LEA practice, some clear patterns emerged in our survey, including preference for opioid-containing  NCBIGene1433  NCBIGene1433  and maintenance with PIEB, PCEA, and dilute epidural solutions.

Recent studies have implicated astrocytes in both protective and pathogenic roles impacting Hu MESHD006816 HD MESHD006816 progression. Objective: The goal of this study is to determine if phagocytosis of cellular debris is compromised in HD s MESHD006816 iatal astrocytes. Methods: Primary adult astrocytes were derived from two HD m MESHD006816 s NCBITaxon10090  NCBITaxon10090 els; the fast-progressing R6/2 and slower progressing Q175. With the use of laser nanosurgery, a single astrocyte was lysed within an astrocyte network. The phagocytic response of astrocytes was observed with phase contrast and by fluorescence microscopy for GFP-LC3 transiently transfected cells. Results: Astrocyte phagocytosis was significantly diminished in primary astrocytes, consistent with the progression of HD i MESHD006816 R6/2 and Q175 mous NCBITaxon10090  NCBITaxon10090 els. This was defined by the number of astrocytes responding via phagocytosis and by the average number of vesicles formed per cell.

35454502	Electrochemical Self-Assembled Gold Nanoparticle SERS Substrate Coupled with Diazotization for Sensitive Detection of  MESHD009573  The accurate determination of  MESHD009573  in food samples is of great significance for ensuring people's health and safety. Herein, a rapid and low-cost detection method was developed for highly sensitive and selective detection of  MESHD009573  based on a surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) sensor combined with electrochemical technology and diazo reaction. In this work, a gold nanoparticle (AuNP)/ MESHC109984  ( MESHC109984 ) chip as a superior SERS substrate was obtained by electrochemical self-assembled AuNPs on ITO with the advantages of good uniformity, high reproducibility, and long-time stability. The  MESHD001391  generated from the diazotization-coupling reaction between  MESHD009573 ,  MESHC064316  ( MESHC064316 ), and  MESHC008588  ( MESHC008588 ) in acid condition were further assembled on the surface of AuNP/ITO. The detection of  MESHD009573  was realized using a portable Raman spectrometer based on the significant SERS enhancement of  MESHD001391  assembled on the AuNP/ITO chip. Many experimental conditions were optimized such as the time of electrochemical self-assembly and the concentration of HAuCl4. Under the optimal conditions, the designed SERS sensor could detect nitride in a large linear range from 1.0 x 10-6 to 1.0 x 10-3 mol L-1 with a low limit of detection of 0.33 mumol L-1. Additionally,  MESHD009573  in real samples was further analyzed with a recovery of 95.1-109.7%. Therefore, the proposed SERS method has shown potential application in the detection of  MESHD009573  in complex food samples. 
35457702	Bibliometric and Density Visualisation Mapping Analysis of Domestic Violence in Australia Research Output 1984-2019 Domestic violence is highly prevalent in Australia and has serious and complex impacts. This study aimed to analyse research outputs on domestic violence in Australia from the period of 1984 to 2019. Articles relevant to domestic violence in Australia that met specified inclusion criteria were retrieved using the Scopus database. Bibliometric analysis of the output was conducted to examine trends in publications. A trend of an increase in publications relating to domestic violence in Australia over time was identified, with the majority published in institutions located in densely populated capital cities. Significant diversity was found in the subject matter of highly cited articles, reflecting the far-reaching impacts of domestic violence. The increase in social attention to domestic violence over time was reflected in an increase in publications. Future research would benefit from examining trends in the reporting of domestic violence, and analysing the effectiveness of interventions for perpetrators and victims. 
35457070	The Memory Benefit to Aged APP/ NCBIGene19164  NCBIGene19164   NCBITaxon10090  NCBITaxon10090  from Long-Term Intranasal Treatment of Low-Dose  MESHD013759   MESHD013759  has been used as a promising treatment approach for  MESHD009422 , but the highly psychoactive effects have largely warned off many scientists from pursuing it further. We conducted an intranasal treatment using low-dose  MESHD013759  on 12-month-old APP/ NCBIGene19164  NCBIGene19164   NCBITaxon10090  NCBITaxon10090  daily for 3 months to overcome any potential psychoactive response induced by the systemic delivery. Our results demonstrate that the  MESHD013759  nasal treatment at 0.002 and 0.02 mg/kg significantly slowed the  MESHD003072  compared to that in the vehicle-treated  NCBITaxon10090  NCBITaxon10090   NCBITaxon10090  NCBITaxon10090  control group. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay showed that the Abeta1-40 and 1-42 peptides decreased in the  MESHD013759 -treated groups. The Western blot data indicate that long-term low-dose  MESHD013759  intranasal administration promoted p-tau level reduction and mitochondrial function marker redistribution. The blood biochemical parameter data demonstrate some insignificant changes in cytokine, immunoglobulin, and immune cell profiles during intranasal  MESHD013759  treatment. Intranasal delivery is a non-invasive and convenient method that rapidly targets therapeutics to the brain, minimizing systemic exposure to avoid unwanted adverse effects. Our study provides new insights into the role of low-dose  MESHD013759  intranasal treatment as a pharmacological strategy to counteract alterations in  MESHD000544 -related cognitive performance. 
35454267	Influence of Conditioning and Expansion Characteristics on the Apparent Metabolizable Energy and Standardized Ileal Amino Acid Digestibility of Full-Fat  NCBITaxon3847  NCBITaxon3847  for Broilers Simple Summary Full-fat  NCBITaxon3847  NCBITaxon3847  (FFSB) is a valuable source of energy and protein for poultry and is obtained by cracking raw  NCBITaxon3847  NCBITaxon3847  without cooking or  MESHD009821  extraction. However, due to the presence of trypsin inhibitors and lectins, raw FFSB is not used in poultry diets. These anti-nutritional factors are, however, heat-labile, and a proper hydrothermal process will inactivate these factors, eliminating their adverse effects on nutrient utilization and bird performance. The aim of the present study was to investigate the influence of conditioning and expansion characteristics on the apparent metabolizable energy and standardized ileal digestibility ( MESHD013398 ) of amino acids (AA) in FFSB for broilers. Based on the results, long-term conditioning at 100  C for 6 min followed by expansion with 18 kWh/t specific energy input increased the metabolizable energy and  MESHD013398  AA of FFSB. Further increases in conditioning time above 6 min or expansion of specific energy input above 18 kWh/t did not offer any advantages to metabolizable energy and AA digestibility of FFSB. Abstract This study investigated the influence of short-term and long-term conditioning and expansion on the n MESHD009584 corrected apparent metabolizable energy (AMEn) and standardized ileal digestibility (S MESHD013398  of amino acids (AA) in full-fat s NCBITaxon3847  NCBITaxon3847 (FFSB) for broilers. A batch of raw s NCBITaxon3847  NCBITaxon3847 was used to manufacture 10 FFSB products (T0 to T9) by applying various combinations of conditioning and expansion. The AMEn and S MESHD013398 AA of FFSB were determined by difference and direct methods, respectively. All heat treatments increased (p < 0.001) the AMEn compared to raw FFSB. The sample subjected to long-term conditioning at 100  C for 6 min and expansion at 18 kWh/t (T5) supported 3.88 M MESHD009207 kg higher AMEn than the raw FFSB. Raw FFSB had the poorest (p < 0.05) AA digestibility. Among the heat-treated samples, the highest (p < 0.05) S MESHD013398 AA was recorded for T5. The results demonstrated that the long-term conditioning of FFSB at 100  C for 6 min prior to expansion with 18 kWh/t specific energy input enhanced metabolizable energy and S MESHD013398 AA. Further increases in conditioning time from 6 to 9 min or expansion of specific energy input from 18 to 28 kWh/t did not yield additional benefits to energy utilization and AA digestibility of FFSB. 
35455561	The Evaluation of  NCBIGene2260  NCBIGene2260 ,  NCBIGene2263  NCBIGene2263  and  NCBIGene2308  NCBIGene2308  in Orofacial Cleft Tissue Although  MESHD002971  with or without  MESHD002972  (CL/P) is one of the most common  MESHD000013  worldwide, the morphopathogenesis of  MESHC566419  is still unclear. Many candidate genes have been proposed to play a causal role; however, only a few have been confirmed, leaving many still to be assessed. Taking into account the significance of  NCBIGene2260  NCBIGene2260 ,  NCBIGene2263  NCBIGene2263  and  NCBIGene2308  NCBIGene2308  in embryogenesis, the aim of this work was to detect and compare the three candidate genes in cleft-affected  NCBIGene23049  NCBIGene23049  and palatine tissue. Ten soft tissue samples were taken during cheiloplasty and veloplasty. The signals of the candidate genes were visualized using chromogenic in situ hybridization and analyzed using a semi-quantitative method. No statistically important difference in the distribution of  NCBIGene2260  NCBIGene2260 ,  NCBIGene2263  NCBIGene2263  and  NCBIGene2308  NCBIGene2308  between neither the patients'  NCBIGene23049  NCBIGene23049  and vomer mucosa nor the control group was observed. Statistically significant very strong and strong correlations were found between genes in the  NCBIGene23049  NCBIGene23049  and palatine tissue. The expression of  NCBIGene2260  NCBIGene2260 ,  NCBIGene2263  NCBIGene2263  and  NCBIGene2308  NCBIGene2308  in cleft-affected  NCBIGene23049  NCBIGene23049  and palatine tissue seems to be highly individual. Numerous intercorrelations between the genes do not exclude their role in the possible complex morphopathogenesis of orofacial clefts. 
35457280	Bone Marrow Niches of Hematopoietic Stem and Progenitor Cells The mammalian hematopoietic system is remarkably efficient in meeting an organism's vital needs, yet is highly sensitive and exquisitely regulated. Much of the organismal control over  MESHC536227  comes from the regulation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) by specific microenvironments called niches in bone marrow (BM), where HSCs reside. The experimental studies of the last two decades using the most sophisticated and advanced techniques have provided important data on the identity of the niche cells controlling HSCs functions and some mechanisms underlying niche-HSC interactions. In this review we discuss various aspects of organization and functioning of the HSC cell niche in bone marrow. In particular, we review the anatomy of BM niches, various cell types composing the niche, niches for more differentiated cells, metabolism of HSCs in relation to the niche, niche aging, leukemic transformation of the niche, and the current state of HSC niche modeling in vitro. 
35456702	Evaluation of CTB-sLip for Targeting  MESHD015179  Lung metastasis of  MESHD015179  is common in the clinic; however, precise targeting for the diagnosis and therapy purposes of those  MESHD009362  remains challenging. Herein,  NCBIGene236899  NCBIGene236899  ( NCBIGene236899  NCBIGene236899 ) protein was chemically conjugated on the surface of PEGylated liposomes (CTB-sLip). Both human-derived  MESHD015179  cell lines,  CVCL0291  and  CVCL0320 , demonstrated high binding affinity and cellular uptake with  NCBIGene9468  NCBIGene9468 -sLip. In vivo, CTB-sLip exhibited elevated targeting capability to the lung metastasis of  MESHD015179  in the model  NCBITaxon10090  NCBITaxon10090  in comparison to PEGylated liposomes (sLip) without  NCBIGene236899  NCBIGene236899  modification.  NCBIGene236899  NCBIGene236899  conjugation induced ignorable effects on the interaction between liposomes and plasma proteins but significantly enhanced the uptake of liposomes by numerous blood cells and splenic cells, leading to relatively rapid blood clearance in BALB/c  NCBITaxon10090  NCBITaxon10090 . Even though repeated injections of CTB-sLip induced the production of anti- NCBIGene236899  NCBIGene236899  antibodies, our results suggested  NCBIGene236899  NCBIGene236899 -sLip as promising nanocarriers for the diagnosis of  MESHD015179 . 
35458663	 MESHD003998  Monoesters in beta- and delta-Lactam Synthesis A N-(2-methoxy-2-oxoethyl)-N-(phenylsulfonyl)glycine monomethyl ester of the respective  MESHD003998  was involved in a reaction with imines promoted by  MESHC031800  at an elevated temperature. Instead of the initially expected delta-lactam products of the Castagnoli-Cushman-type reaction, medicinally important 3-amino-2-azetidinones were obtained as the result of cyclization, involving a methylene group adjacent to an acid moiety. In contrast, replacing  MESHD000438  residue with hexafluoroisopropyl in the same substrate made another methylene group (adjacent to the  MESHD004952  moiety) more reactive to furnishing the desired delta-lactam in the Castagnoli-Cushman fashion. 
35492406	Physiological acclimation of  NCBIGene131096  NCBIGene131096  during population restoration in the Missouri Ozarks, USA Abstract Conservation translocations:the intentional movement of animals to restore populations:have increased over the past 30 years to halt and reverse species declines and losses. However, there are many challenges translocated animals face that should be considered for restoration programs to be successful. Understanding how long it takes for translocated animals to acclimate to these challenges and their new landscape is a critical component of post-release population management. Physiological measures such as hormone responses are increasingly used to assess animal responses and acclimation to disturbances including translocation. We determined the physiological acclimation period of  NCBIGene131096  NCBIGene131096  ( NCBITaxon9861  NCBITaxon9861 ) translocated to the Missouri Ozarks, USA, as part of a restoration effort. From 2011 to 2013, we translocated 108 GPS-radio-collared  NCBIGene131096  NCBIGene131096  from Kentucky, USA, to Missouri, USA, and collected faecal samples for glucocorticoid metabolite extraction to use as an indicator of physiological acclimation. We modelled the response of population-wide faecal glucocorticoid metabolites (fGCMs) across the initial 9 years of the restoration in response to days following release and additional site-specific covariates. Presence of  NCBITaxon9874  NCBITaxon9874  ( NCBITaxon9874  NCBITaxon9874 ) hunts and monthly precipitation levels were positively and negatively associated with fGCM levels, respectively. Concurrent with influences from site-specific conditions on the release landscape, fGCM levels declined following release. We identified a breakpoint in fGCM decline at ~42 days following translocation releases suggesting  NCBIGene131096  NCBIGene131096  acclimated physiologically relatively quickly compared to other species. The fast physiological acclimation by Missouri  NCBIGene131096  NCBIGene131096  suggests effective use of temporary post-release management efforts. Determining how quickly animals acclimate following translocations allows researchers to tailor post-release management plans to each species' needs, thus maximizing the success of future translocation efforts while minimizing costs. 
35351860	Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomal microRNA-381-3p alleviates  MESHD061205  by targeting NFAT5  MESHD061205  (VC) is a significant complication of  MESHD051436  (CKD) and cellular apoptosis is one of the intricate mechanisms of VC. Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosome (BMSC-Exo) alleviates VC, but the mechanism remains unclear. We investigated the mechanism of BMSC-Exo using high  MESHD010710  stimulated Human aortic smooth muscle cells (HA-VSMCs) and 5/6 subtotal nephrectomy ( NCBIGene310  NCBIGene310 )  NCBITaxon10116  NCBITaxon10116  models. We demonstrated that the effect of BMSC-Exo on the inhibition of cellular apoptosis and  MESHD002114  partially depended on exosomal microRNA-381-3p (miR-381-3p) both in vivo and in vitro, and confirmed that miR-381-3p could inhibit  NCBIGene307820  NCBIGene307820  ( NCBIGene307820  NCBIGene307820 ) expression by directly binding to its 3' untranslated region. Additionally, we found that severe  MESHD002114  of arteries in dialysis patients was associated with decreased miR-381-3p and increased  NCBIGene10725  NCBIGene10725  expression levels. Collectively, our findings proved that BMSC-Exo plays anti- MESHD002114  and anti-apoptosis roles in CKD by delivering enclosed miR-381-3p, which directly targets  NCBIGene10725  NCBIGene10725  mRNA, and leads to a better understanding of the mechanism of  MESHD012080 . 
35498133	Association of the Combined Effects between  NCBIGene3479  NCBIGene3479  Gene Polymorphisms and Negative Life Events with Major  MESHD000275  among Chinese population in the Context of Oxidative  MESHD000079225  Background  Oxidative stress may be increased in a number of  MESHD001523 , including major  MESHD000275  ( MESHD003865 ).  MESHD003865  has been shown to be related to  NCBIGene3479  NCBIGene3479  ( NCBIGene3479  NCBIGene3479 ) as well as to negative life events; exploring the interaction of  NCBIGene3479  NCBIGene3479  polymorphisms and negative life events on the risk of  MESHD003865  is needed. The aim of this study was to analyze the single and combined effects of  NCBIGene3479  NCBIGene3479  polymorphisms ( SNPtmvar:rs972936  SNPvariantgroup:4  SNPcorrespondinggene:3479  SNPrs#:972936  SNPcorrespondingspecies:9606  and  SNPtmvar:rs978458  SNPvariantgroup:1  SNPcorrespondinggene:3479  SNPrs#:978458  SNPcorrespondingspecies:9606 ) and negative life events with  MESHD003865  among Chinese population.  Methods  420  MESHD003865  patients (according to DSM-V) and 420 age- and gender-matched control subjects were recruited in a case-control study. Negative life events were assessed using standard rating scales.  NCBIGene3479  NCBIGene3479   SNPtmvar:rs972936  SNPvariantgroup:4  SNPcorrespondinggene:3479  SNPrs#:972936  SNPcorrespondingspecies:9606  and  SNPtmvar:rs978458  SNPvariantgroup:1  SNPcorrespondinggene:3479  SNPrs#:978458  SNPcorrespondingspecies:9606  were identified by sequencing. The chi-square (chi2) tests were performed to explore the association of negative life events and  NCBIGene3479  NCBIGene3479  polymorphisms with  MESHD003865 .  Results  Our results found that the negative life events were associated with the risk of  MESHD003865  (P < 0.001; OR = 3.28, 95% CI: 2.19-4.85). The genotypes of  NCBIGene3479  NCBIGene3479  were associated with the risk of  MESHD003865  (P < 0.001); carrying the  NCBIGene3479  NCBIGene3479   SNPtmvar:rs972936  SNPvariantgroup:4  SNPcorrespondinggene:3479  SNPrs#:972936  SNPcorrespondingspecies:9606  C allele (OR = 1.53, 95% CI: 1.26-1.85) and  SNPtmvar:rs978458  SNPvariantgroup:1  SNPcorrespondinggene:3479  SNPrs#:978458  SNPcorrespondingspecies:9606  T allele (OR = 1.92, 95% CI: 1.58-2.34) had a higher risk of  MESHD003865 . The combined effects between  NCBIGene3479  NCBIGene3479   SNPtmvar:rs978458  SNPvariantgroup:1  SNPcorrespondinggene:3479  SNPrs#:978458  SNPcorrespondingspecies:9606  and negative life events were associated with the risk of  MESHD003865  (P < 0.05; OR = 2.94, 95% CI: 1.23-7.03), but  NCBIGene3479  NCBIGene3479   SNPtmvar:rs972936  SNPvariantgroup:4  SNPcorrespondinggene:3479  SNPrs#:972936  SNPcorrespondingspecies:9606  was not associated (P > 0.05).  Conclusions  Based on the oxidative stress hypothesis, we confirm that carrying  NCBIGene3479  NCBIGene3479   SNPtmvar:rs972936  SNPvariantgroup:4  SNPcorrespondinggene:3479  SNPrs#:972936  SNPcorrespondingspecies:9606  C allele and  SNPtmvar:rs978458  SNPvariantgroup:1  SNPcorrespondinggene:3479  SNPrs#:978458  SNPcorrespondingspecies:9606  T allele have a higher risk of  MESHD003865  and the combined effects between  NCBIGene3479  NCBIGene3479   SNPtmvar:rs978458  SNPvariantgroup:1  SNPcorrespondinggene:3479  SNPrs#:978458  SNPcorrespondingspecies:9606  and negative life events were associated with the risk of  MESHD003865  among Chinese population. 
35354635	Efficacy of the Gelstix nucleus augmentation device for the treatment of chronic  MESHD017116 : protocol for a randomised, sham-controlled, double-blind, multicentre trial Introduction Discogenic  MESHD010146  is the cause of  MESHD010146  in 26%-40% of patients with for  MESHD017116 . Consensus about treatment of chronic  MESHD017116  is lacking and most treatment alternatives are supported by limited evidence. The percutaneous implantation of hydrogels into the nucleus pulposus represents a promising regenerative intradiscal therapy. The hydrogel 'GelStix' is composed primarily of hydrolyzed  MESHC010504  and acts as a reservoir of hydration, producing increased pressure and improved pH balance, potentially leading to disc preservation. We hypothesise that treatment with GelStix will lead to greater reduction in  MESHD010146  intensity at 6 months post-treatment compared with patients receiving sham treatment. Methods and analysis This is a parallel group, randomised sham-controlled double-blind, multicentre trial to assess whether the GelStix device is superior to sham in reducing pain int MESHD010146 ty in patients with chronic  MESHD017116 udy will be conducted in two regional hospitals in Europe. Seventy-two participants will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio. The primary outcome will be the change in pain int MESHD010146 ty between preoperative baseline and at 6 months postintervention. Secondary outcomes were disability, quality of life, the patient's global impression of change scale, the use of pain med MESHD010146 ion and the disc deg MESHD055959  assessed by means of MRI. For change in pain int MESHD010146 ty, disability, health-related quality of life and disc height, mean values will be compared between groups using linear regression analysis, adjusted for treatment centre. Ethics and dissemination Ethics approval was obtained from the Ethics Committee of the Canton Ticino, Switzerland (CE2982) and  CVCL9L80  Medical Ethical Committee Arnhem-Nijmegen, the Netherlands (2016-2944). All patients that agree to participate will be asked to sign an informed consent form. Results will be disseminated through international publications in peer-reviewed journals, in addition to international conference presentations. Trial registration number NCT02763956. Protocol version 7.1, 18 November 2020.
